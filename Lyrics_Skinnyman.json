We go hurt them?\nFirebomb the letter box and leave them all burning\nIf they coming running, my bullets gonna splurt them\nI\u2019m all out to hurt them and leave them for dead\nMaking sure every one of them gets one in the head\nI\u2019m running it red\nNot thinking about running from Feds\nThe only thoughts that I\u2019m having is to fill them full of lead\nI didn\u2019t wanna have to go resort to all the bloodshed\nBut now it\u2019s kill or be killed and left on your death bed\nAs I look into the face of this crack-basing demon\nKnowing he\u2019s the type who rapes his own semen\nWhat do you believe in\nThe dark or the light?\nI know I\u2019m gonna be surprised if I make it through tonight\nYou might also like[Hook]\n\n[Outro - Spoken dialogue between two characters]\nTrevor: They don't know I did it\nHarry: But you're telling me?\nTrevor: Yeah\nHarry: Great!\nTrevor: I'm turning myself in to you Harry, as you're my mate, you can collect the reward\nHarry: Crapping on your own doorstep?\n* Picks up rotary telephone receiver *\nHarry: We'll let them deal with it\n* Begins dialling rotary phone*\nTrevor: They'll stand on me Harry, they don't like me there, I've been there before. They'll roll me in a mattress and they'll boot me\n* Hangs up phone *\nHarry: What's that to a brick shithouse like you?\n* Begins dialling again *\nTrevor: I smashed a police car with a Transit, send me to another nick\nHarry: Your shit, you roll in it. You're an arsehole, you're not worth a piss\nTrevor: Right1Embed"

I keep a watch over the whole of my acres\nTo those who wanna take us from 5'0's to fakers\nCuz all were tryin'a be is money makers\nSo we might have had a chance to escape from some of these derelict places\nWe're livin life at fast paces\nIt's like were gutter rats tryin'a contend these rap races\nSo best to tighten up your laces\nCuz this year I'm steppin up a gear too fast for you to chase us\nYou think I'd wanna stick around this town\nAnd have to wait for a crackhead to beat my mum down\nTo get a phone call sayin just bring your money now\nBy any little fassy with a bucky runnin round\nI don't love the sound of what those haters wanna do to me\nThats why I'm not givin them any opportunity\nFor me its not about all of the money and the jewellrey\nSurvival of the fittest is life so now its you or me\nAnd I don't wanna move away from the flats\nBut thats they only way for me to get away from these cats\nI sit and wonder why the fuck it has to be like that\nAnd wonder it would have been like if we blew up in rap\nBut that's a dream and me I put reality first\nAnd yeah its real that these theives wanna steal your mums purse\nDoes it seem, the whole of this manor is cursed\nLike the bubble is boilin and just waitin to burst\nThis generations gettin worse - these youth man are comin up\nNuttins out there for 'em so they just don't give a fuck\nAnd they ain't got nuttin to lose so them\nThey're out on streets late nights confused again\nYou put your feet in their shoes for them\nAnd you see what you can do for them\nAnd you too might screw for them\nAnd this ain't really nuttin new for them\nA man like you will probably label them a hooligan\nTo live good or bad, but me I'm mud cause the hood is bad\nDressin in rags on the ags you know my hood is mad\nWith worry bout gettin beat up or stabbed\nNow we worry bout the man thats come to shoot up the ave'\nThe dreams we used to have are gone\nFor those hopes are basic needs we're in the bottom of the barrel tryin'a fight for life's necessities\nThis older man takin time to give advice to me\nTryina show me just how nice my life could be\nI'd like to share the vision\nBut all I see is man on a mission\nMy streets are full of friction\nAnd you can check my diction\nIt gets deep everywhere that you go\nCuz theres snakes everywhere in every ghetto you go\nWo wo...\n[Outro: \"interviewer\"]\n\"So there we have it, a live interview from Skinnyman\nOutside subterania-the infamous home of hip hop-this is Mudfam and Kat signing out...\"\n\n[Skit: Made In Britain - Trevor and Barry]\nThat\u2019s being honest innit. You don't really want me to be honest do ya?\nYes I do\nRight, honestly speaking, I don't think I can honestly keep the peace while I'm incarcerated in this shithouse or any other shithouse, contract or no contract, so there's no point in saying I will is there! How's that for honesty? See you can't take it can ya. It's the same when I was at school. I said when I was bored, when I didn't want to do a lesson, when I wanted to have a fag, when I wanted to tell the teacher to fuck off for being a wanker, or kick him in the teeth. But they couldn't take it. They didn't want me to be honest in that way. That's why you don't have lessons in honesty, 9.00-10.30 honesty. They don't want the kids to say what they're really thinking and feeling inside their heads. If they had lessons like that, they'd lose control! Wouldn't be able to smack you round the head when they feel like it. You just want me to be honest when you take me down the nick. \"Fair cop, guv.\" Or when I fill out a form. \"Be honest, don't cheat, don't carry a knife.\" Bend over; let me search you, make notes about you, keep files on you. If I'm honest, I've got nothing to worry about have I? You're protecting me from the dishonest buggers, ain't ya? But I can't look at the files. What's read out by the magistrate, what those fuckers said about me at school, what's on the police computer it's a lot of bollocks! We're not talking about honesty, we\u2019re talking about sticking to the rules! All those honest people out there are just sticking to the rules, but they lie and fucking cheat all the way! They just think they're being honest cuss they swallowed the bollocks they've been handed, they've been conned! Well, I've not been conned. That's why you can stick your hairy contract up your hairy arse! It\u2019s a dishonest con!You might also likeEmbed"

Rite blud?\nFucking with this thing called life blud\nI've never been the one whose ever been the grimey type blud\nFrom when I was a nut getting bust, I had to fight blud\nAnd I can't see myself try'n'a give up on life blud\nNot light blud, I really wanna see the light blud\nI mean I wanna fix up, and make tings right blud\nNow I wanna fix my life blud\nI mean I wanna make tings right blud\nAnd see that light blud\n(Well, those are your options, and you've created 'em, you've brought it all upon yourself...\nBefore you kick another door down, or you kick another chef in the bollocks)You might also likeEmbed"

Me, listen..\nThis time when we splash, trust we're gonna splash\nThey're gonna wanna come up and run up on us with their mash\nMen are gonna stand firm, some are gonna dash\nSome of them boys just ain't ready for the clash\nWhen you don't see your life past you by in a flash\nCuz others wanna hate on the fact ya make cash\nEverything they've tried to achieve has seemed to crash\nThey're left walkin' up and down road lookin' brass\nAlas, most of them men are fassyoles\nEvery two weeks they have to sign for dole\nI'm on another level blood, check it, I'm-a roll\nRippin' down any spot with my fam in tow\nYou dun kno how that go, any way you want it\nSo any which way, blood I'm on it, so run it\nYou, Who? You, Me, listen..\n\nI used to roll deep with a crew of nasty soldiers\nNow I hold heat, carryin' that weight on my shoulders\nThe way that I've been raised is too much to get over\nThe way the streets have tried to mould us then hold us to the pavement\nNow we're facin' modern day enslavement\nGettin' shift, lookin' at the world behind the jail fence\nTwenty three hours locked down is how your day's spent\nThinkin' 'bout the way all of my old school braves went\nCuz I been here puttin' it down for years\nI've watched my silent screams fall prey to death ears\nNothings left here but a whole heap of fuckery\nAll over the country road is lookin' ugly, trust me\nFrom the age of ten years old\nCertain runnings that I've been through remain untold\n\nYou Who? You Me..\n\nThat's why I resurface, cause everything I hear sounds worthless\nMan dem wanna play your part, they know your purpose\nI know my heart, my rhyme's stomp full of curses\nMakin' every one around me start actin' nervous\nCall doctors and nurses, emergency services\nPull it back like cartwheel spin reverses\nCheck my verses, the way I'm puttin' 'em down\nThe way I'm shuttin' 'em down, I'm not fuckin' around\nI'm cleanin' up town like some old street sweepers\nIn broad daylight, I roll with night time creepers\nWhoever want to eat us, beef us or show my peeps love\nThe others can meet their Grim Reapers\nForget bein' six feet deep dug, it don't matter\nAfter I've left ya with ya skull bone shattered\nThe heads that you see me roll ain't no rappers\nGun clappers who live like nuttin don't matterYou might also likeEmbed"

Kick me in the bollocks if that's what you feel like doing, 'cause I'll do the same to you when I feel like it, so goodnight and FUCK OFF to ya!\n\n\n[Chorus]\nI put my life in my rhymes, now I tell ya dem\nI did it all on my own, I didn't beg no friend\nI done been thru it all, just to get those ends\nDid I do every ting I said I would?\n(Well?!) Well, then?\nI put my life in my rhymes, now I tell ya dem\nI did it all on my own, I didn't beg no friend\nI done been thru it all, just to get those ends\nDid I do every ting I said I would?\n(Well?!) Well, then?\n\n\n[Verse 1]\nLet me try come and explain about the life we live\nSurrounded by the negativity tryna be positive\nWe hustle in the struggle\n'Cause we know that something's go to give\nSometimes we don't know what to give\nStill we've got a lot to give\nA man of many talents\nAnd I find I have to shot to live\n'Cause we know about what being really bruck pocket is\nGetting laid on more weed to make a profit with\nRaggo, not caring on road just how hot it is\nKidnapped by crackheads with guns hoping they'll let ya be\nSitting in a jail house waiting for the day they'll set ya free\nSituations that you wouldn't really wanna get to see\nTrying hard not to let all this stress get to me\nLife is not a game, and any day it could be jeopardy\nWhen so many lickle fassyholes wanna step to me\nAnywhere I go I have to bop with my weaponry\nWhen all I wanna do is try give people the best of me\nDodging the feds because they wanna be arresting me\nJust for this high grade weed that is blessing me\nLessons in life has got reality depressing me\nMy food for the brain is the high grade recipe!\nYou might also like\n[Chorus]\nI put my life in my rhymes, now I tell ya dem\nI did it all on my own, I didn't beg no friend\nI done been thru it all, just to get those ends\nDid I do every ting I said I would?\n(Well?!) Well, then?\n\nI put my life in my rhymes, now I tell ya dem\nI did it all on my own, I didn't beg no friend\nI done been thru it all, just to get those ends\nDid I do every ting I said I would?\n(Well?!) Well, then?\n\n\n[Verse 2]\nNobody's gonna be avenging me\nWhen I'm facing all of my enemies\nI know the afterlife's a place where man wanna be sending me\nSo who do I depend on? ME\nThey say prevention is better than any cure\nSo fuck looking for a remedy!\nBulletproof vests ain't gonna stop man from ending me\nThey're aiming for my head as if I'm J. F. (Kennedy!)\nLickle fassyholes are sending me into a state of paranoia from anybody who's tryna make a friend of me\nLiving in this gun life 'cause mandem wanna done life\nEvery minute of the day been ready for a gunfight\n24/7 forever fretting for my son's life\nHoping that his mum is staying clear from the scum type\nLike crackhead who bun pipe\nTheir minds just don't run right!\nSo many people take the wrong path in their young life\nReady to kill man if man's gonna make a killing\nAnd if you wanna be living, you gotta be ready and willing!\n\n[Chorus]\nI put my life in my rhymes, now I tell ya dem\nI did it all on my own, I didn't beg no friend\nI done been thru it all, just to get those ends\nDid I do every ting I said I would?\n(Well?!) Well, then?\n\nI put my life in my rhymes, now I tell ya dem\nI did it all on my own, I didn't beg no friend\nI done been thru it all, just to get those ends\nDid I do every ting I said I would?\n(Well?!) Well, then?\n\n\n[Verse 3]\nI keep my game face with it\n'Cause as long as you're making it\nThere's always gonna be somebody who wanna be taking it\nMy bread's only breaking with\nPeople who I really feel in my heart\nDeserve to ever claim a stake in it\nThere's no mistaking it\nReal recognise real in my field\nAnd I can tell when man's faking it\nMy clique couldn't never roll tight with a snake in it\nGive my trust, next ting man's starting misplacing it\nMy heart holds a place in the street\nThere's no escaping it\nNow I stand firm on some 'Fuck you blatant' shit\nSome people say that we're destined for greater shit\nTrying to get to eat right now while I'm looking paper quick\nSo don't be coming chatting shit I'm not relating with\nNobody in this British rap game is making it\nCouldn't move their mums off of the council estate with it\nSo, I'll be in the park shotting weed, check me later, shit...\n\n\n[Chorus]\nI put my life in my rhymes, now I tell ya dem\nI did it all on my own, I didn't beg no friend\nI done been thru it all, just to get those ends\nDid I do every ting I said I would?\n(Well?!) Well, then?\n\nI put my life in my rhymes, now I tell ya dem\nI did it all on my own, I didn't beg no friend\nI done been thru it all, just to get those ends\nDid I do every ting I said I would?\n(Well?!) Well, then?\n\n\n[Outro, Skinnyman & Made in Britain:]\nAnd that's coming from Sounding Straight Grimey Studios where we don't give a FUCK about the final mix. It's just hip-hop for my peeps on the streets. Dealing with the radio stations that have got it loc, and the DJs that have got it loc. You know where to get my shit, if you don't, then you're not involved, blud. Ya nah what i mean? Check uncle legga legga\n\nI don't know, Trevor. I really don't know what are we gonna do...\n\n\u2014About what?\n\nAbout you, Tr...\n\n\u2014No, about you, what the FUCK are we gonna do about you?!!! If you had any balls, you'd stick a knife in the bastards who write all that bollocks, they're wankers! They're just like teachers at school, they're all fucking wankers!Embed"

With your free CD promote a free track\nLess them chiefs allow me, I don't need that\nI ain't spitting on the mic unless it's gonna feed that\nI'm in the park for man who's asking, 'Where's the weed at?'\nI weed dat! You know where my high-grade trees at\nWave your spliffs in the air, now make me see that\nBall it up loud, tell the government to free that\n14 years for shotting weed, but I me dat\n[Chorus]\nI see some mandem tryna put in the work\nAnd getting left in the dirt\nAnd now all they've got left\nIs their pride and it hurts\nTryna represent\nBut that ain't paying the rent\nTime is money, on the street is where my time is spent\n\nI see some mandem tryna put in the work\nAnd getting left in the dirt\nAnd now all they've got left\nIs their pride and it hurts\nTryna represent\nBut that ain't paying the rent\nTime is money, on the street is where my time is spent\n\n[Verse 2]\nThat's why I do the graveyard shift\nWith a bouquet of flowers\nAsk Esraw if we don't work them gangster hours\nNocturnally\nYou can burn with me until the sunrise\nWork the shift through until the moon's in the sky\nDay in, day out\nGet my reload\nPay in, pay out\nWorking hard to buy my baby mums a house\nMy whole life has been lived irresponsible\nHustling and fighting, and dodging police constables\nIt's those circumstances that we're living in\nStressed out to fuck and still we're never giving in\nMy son's out on road, I pray the Lord delivers him\nFrom all of the evil that we do 'cause nobody's see-through!\nRun up on me, and I'll get to see you\nStart acting digi like your name's R2-D2\nWe're street soldiers fighting for all the wars\nSo big up to everyone who's working hard for the cause!\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI see some mandem tryna put in the work\nAnd getting left in the dirt\nAnd now all they've got left\nIs their pride and it hurts\nTryna represent\nBut that ain't paying the rent\nTime is money, on the street is where my time is spent\n\nI see some mandem tryna put in the work\nAnd getting left in the dirt\nAnd now all they've got left\nIs their pride and it hurts\nTryna represent\nBut that ain't paying the rent\nTime is money, on the street is where my time is spent\n\n[Verse 3]\nMy lickle brudda Obi told me what don't kill me\nCan only make me stronger\nThat's why I'm planning to be in this game longer\nThan little whipper-snappers, come-and-go rappers\nAren't they forgetting that we're the dog's knackers?\nMurdering those stick-up kids, to kidnappers\nBring it to me now, you lickle push ne malakas\nI hustle too hard for me to ever be a brackers\nIn London, the land of these young gun clappers\nWhere it's... M.U.D. for life\nAnd after my death\nI'm repping Muddy Fam until the last of my breath\nAt this point I've only got 6 bars left\nBut I feel there's more shit for me to stress\nTo my poor unemployed down at the DSS\nTo my peeps on the streets that are tryna progress\nTo my peeps locked down with a couple weeks left\nThis is the type of shit we have to manifest, yes!\n[Chorus]\nI see some mandem tryna put in the work\nAnd getting left in the dirt\nAnd now all they've got left\nIs their pride and it hurts\nTryna represent\nBut that ain't paying the rent\nTime is money, on the street is where my time is spent\n\nYes, I've seen some mandem tryna put in the work\nAnd getting left in the dirt\nAnd now all they've got left\nIs their pride and it hurts\nTryna represent\nBut that ain't paying the rent\nTime is money, on the street is where my time is spentEmbed"

over!\nX4\n\nFirst Verse\n(Skinnyman)\nWe're coming grimey like baggy trousers and dirty shirts\nHow many years we been putting in work\nWe keep it real to the point of their feelings are getting hurt\nWe show them they're bitches when we yank off their skirt\nNo resilience, MUD fam comes militant\nNever hesitant as a Finsbury resident\nAggy this and aggy that, i'm full of aggy chat\nGot an aggy yute that I bred from an aggy yat\nNow I shot alone on my own from an aggy flat\nAny ag will do it if they wanna see their paper stack\nRaggo, the whole manors parro\nSay it's deep blood, but no it's quite shallow\nWe're glamourising all the wrong tings\nNot all of it is the blingz(?) but give me the rings\nHook\n(Skinnyman)\nBecause we run tings, any tings lets bun tings\nWe're top of the tops, we're calling the shots\nAll I know is that we're running it hot\nAnd who agree with me lick off a shot\nPop pop\n\n(Female Vocalist)\nNow that MUD fam's time is coming in\nIt's over!\n(Skinnyman)\nIt's our time\n(Female Vocalist)\nNow that MUD fam's time is coming in\nIt's over!\n(Skinnyman)\nIt's our time blood, its over now, its over\n(Female Vocalist)\nNow that MUD fam's time is coming in\nIt's over!\n(Skinnyman)\nMudfamalama with another banger\n(Female Vocalist)\nNow that MUD fam's time is coming in\nIt's over!\n(Skinnyman)\nIt's over blood, It's over\nYou might also likeSecond Verse\n(Skinnyman)\nEre what then, come and watch what we got then\nGetting put on from round ere don't happen often\nSo I suppose I'm a lucky little fucker\nIf I'm gonna get played by all you radio suckers\nPut me on rotation, to every station\nTo any nation, I'm showing any fassy blatant\nChat bout your patience we're all sick of waiting\nThe worlds anticipating for the shit we've been creating\nWe're like a boiling pot and now the whistle's blown\nWe've always known we're hot with the style of our own\nNow that the craft Cockney's on the microphone\nYour gonna freak when I take you to another zone\nSo anybody who ain't really on it, run it\nBut if you dont want it, dont bun it\nDont bun it blood\n\nHook\n(Skinnyman)\nBecause we run tings, any tings lets bun tings\nWe're top of the tops, we're calling the shots\nAll I know is that we're running it hot\nAnd who agree with me lick off a shot\nPop pop\n(Female Vocalist) (Skinnyman speaks over the vocalist)\nNow that MUD fam's time is coming in\nIt's over!\n(Skinnyman)\nIt's our time blood, its over\n(Female Vocalist)\nNow that MUD fam's time is coming in\nIt's over!\n(Skinnyman)\nWe've been waiting for our time to come in, now its over\n(Female Vocalist)\nNow that MUD fam's time is coming in\nIt's over!\n(Skinnyman)\nMr Stone show them it's over\n(Female Vocalist)\nNow that MUD fam's time is coming in\nIt's over!\nI can see them coming, I can see (?) running\nI can hear the others saying these our the days for which we've been praying\n(Skinnyman)\nSee them coming, see them run, praying for this to happen\n(Female Vocalist)\nI can see them coming, I can see (?) running\nI can hear the others saying these our the days for which we've been praying\n(Skinnyman)\nI see them coming, I see them fassys there running, this is our day, we been praying for this\n\nVerse Three\n(Skinnyman)\nCos bare fassyoles fascinated in these fascinations\nSo we're setting fire on them blatant\nBurning the barriers\nWe're too heavy for you to carry us\nBest to join along\nTry to learn the song\nThere's no stopping us now that our time has come\nSpitting hot fire from night to the rising sun\nAnd no discrimination, so if you're old or young\nFuck a dress code, come how ya wanna come\nBun what ya wanna bun, highgrade gimme some\nBut don't ask cos where we got it from innit mum\nWe keep it all in the family tight\nAnd you dont wanna see my mum on the mic, right\nThat's like not even waiting for the best to come\nAnd i ain't really ready for done, you ready for mum?\n\nHook\n(Skinnyman)\nBecause we run tings, any tings lets bun tings\nWe're top of the tops, we're calling the shots\nAll I know is that we're running it hot\nAnd who agree with me lick off a shot\nPop pop\n\nWe run tings, any tings lets bun tings\nWe're top of the tops, we're calling the shots\nAll I know is that we're running it hot\nAnd who agree with me lick off a shot\nPop pop\n\n(Female Vocalist)\nNow that MUD fam's time is coming in\nIt's over!\n(Skinnyman)\nIt's our time blood, it's over\n(Female Vocalist)\nNow that MUD fam's time is coming in\nIt's over!\n(Skinnyman)\nOur times coming in for real now its over\n(Female Vocalist)\nNow that MUD fam's time is coming in\nIt's over!\n(Skinnyman)\nMudfamalama show them it's over, Skinnyman wanna show you it's over, Mr Stone show them its over, its over, its over now, it's over, it's our time blood\n(male 'voiceover' vocalist maybe skinnyman though sounds northern)\nAy ay, ay ay, mudfamlama ay ay, our time, Skinnyyy!\n\nSkit\n(Made in Britain dialogue)\n(Barry)\nNow what's going on?\n(Trevor)\nI had a bust up with those wankers you put me with\n(Barry)\nWell you put yourself, not me, I kept you outta there for bloody months, if you can't keep straight for two weeks in a year you're not worth a tossEmbed"
