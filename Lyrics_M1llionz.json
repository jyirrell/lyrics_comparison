  "plain": "Miguel Rahiece Cunningham (b. 6th February 1997), known professionally as M1llionz, is a UK Drill artist hailing from Handsworth in North West Birmingham, West Midlands. The Brum native has blown the scene away with his unique flow and vivid imagery when rapping about his experiences with selling drugs and other crimes.\n\nIn November, 2019, he released his debut track \u201cNorth West\u201d which currently sits on over 1 million views. He then went on to release other notable tracks in a short space of time such as \u201cHDC\u201d, \u201cBX19\u201d and his biggest hit, to date, \u201cY PREE\u201d, which currently has over 2 million views.\n\nM1llionz commercial breakthrough came in the form of hit-single \u201cB1llionz\u201d, which went on to enter the UK Top 40 Singles Charts at #39, and spent five weeks in the Top 100.\n\nIn an interview with GAFFER, M1llionz explained:\n\n\nNever force it. That\u2019s the one thing I will never do with anything in life. Because when you force it, that\u2019s when things happen that you don\u2019t want or need. My music is exactly the same, it\u2019s my release. At that moment, I\u2019m just letting everything I have out. Life is a lesson in patience.\n\nI don\u2019t know where my flow comes from exactly. The way I\u2019ve crossed my sound with the Jamaican influence is different. But, it comes from within me. I\u2019ve always had it. It\u2019s the way I write, innit? I don\u2019t write to beats, for one. And two, I do a thing where I miss the drop. I don\u2019t do things in set form. I like the feel of doing it a little off. I do it because it allows me to tell a proper story (\u2026) If you were doing stuff before that wasn\u2019t too good and you start doing music, you see stuff that you never thought you would have seen. It opens up the world.\n\n\nAlongside the release of his first single of 2021, \u201cBADNIS\u201d, M1llionz announced his debut EP which is set to release in 2021."

(Is he really?)\nFive a week, that's the usual prices, give them six-fif' if they do all nighters (Trappin')\nAnd I just fucked my high school crush, didn't rate me back then so I did it for the cause (Haha)\nI told bro, \"Put the tune on pause, is it just me or is there a knock at the door?\" (Who's that?)\nGun police, only feds with balls, try up and tell a bad man, \"Get on the floor\" (Get where?)\nMan put bujj up in Rizla's raw, shoulda [?] shape like Lindsay's jaw\nWhat's the dynamics? Them man want static\nOne up, still make two youts swim like diving and synchronised aquatics (Ching)\nI don't serve them big Issue addicts (Nah)\nTry and sit on the camera all day then try and bring pennies to fix their habits\nCats get punched up for main road dramatics or tryna flag man down in broad day traffic (Baow)\nTry ask me that the thing ain't green, it's the last time I'm gonna do traders insurance\nBeen chasin' this yout for a minute, don't smoke so I'm really gonna test his endurance\nBro will bring the heat when performing just to make sure it's a comfy performance\nAs long as the cat's still scorin', I promise the zando will never get boring\n\n[Chorus]\nEveryone cattin' man's style\nEvery day, new yout with a M1llionz flow\nSwitched it up, put my dark skin on the M way\nHad my lighty bringin' in smoke\nThis gyal wanna fuck M1llionz, no\nHoe, you best get my niggas involved\nMake my first mil by 2021\nAnd I'll change my name to B1llionz bro (Kerching)\nEveryone cattin' man's style\nEvery day, new yout with a M1llionz flow\nSwitched it up, put my dark skin on the M way\nHad my lighty bringin' in smoke\nThis gyal wanna fuck M1llionz, no\nHoe, you best get my niggas involved\nMake my first mil by 2021\nAnd I'll change my name to B1llionz bro (Kerching)\n[Outro]\n(Rah, it's BKay you kna')Embed"

    "plain": "\u201cBADNIS\u201d is North West Birmingham Drill rapper M1llionz\u2019s first single in 2021, and follows a very successful 2020. M1llionz confirmed that this will be the official intro for his upcoming debut EP.\n\nFor this track, M1llionz goes back to his Jamaican roots through the use of samples, subtle cultural references and even flying out to Jamaica to film the video. The single was even given a Jamaican release time as well as the UK one which further shows the love M1llionz has for his heritage.\n\nNavigating through topics such as fake friends, guns and beefing with his opp\u2019s \u2013 M1llionz picks up exactly where he left off in 2020 and opens the doors with a bang."

M1llionz confirmed that this will be the official intro for his upcoming debut EP.\n\nFor this track, M1llionz goes back to his Jamaican roots through the use of samples, subtle cultural references and even flying out to Jamaica to film the video. The single was even given a Jamaican release time as well as the UK one which further shows the love M1llionz has for his heritage.\n\nNavigating through topics such as fake friends, guns and beefing with his opp\u2019s \u2013 M1llionz picks up exactly where he left off in 2020 and opens the doors with a bang."

(Huh?)\nWho's my man? I don't know him\nFlick button get clicked same time I approach him (Whoosh)\nHMP, I was roastin'\nMy gyal on her mash just rubbin' and moanin'\nMy next door bangin' the wall\nPretend to be a sleep but really I'm zonin' (Pissin' me off)\nTold my girl 'one minute'\nI can hear the night boss creepin' around\nI'm tryna have a convo\nEveryone's at the door beatin' it down (Boom, boom)\nAll gassed over Love Island\nMegan's a slag and she's sleepin' around\nSo I just turn on my set\nPut it on full blast, now I can't hear a sound (Woi-yoi)\n[Outro]\nGhostyYou might also like2Embed"

(Huh)\nI seen one of them last week, to be fair, man, it's deep if I touch up the same guy (Hahaha)\nIt's a stolen A5 cah the ST had a faulty break light (Skrrt)\nNew shape ready on the M way, it's mad though, I still reload on train lines (Mmm)\nFuck Galton Bridge Station, man, New Street got way more options (True)\nRingtone constant, had the old phone like 80's Compton (Brrt, brrt)\nJumpin'\n[?] I ain't stunting\nLove these black tings 'cause they bring all the guns in (Baow)\nWinter, goin' fur on my hood like I'm hunting (Woo)\nMan's bad, this ain't cost him\nI still gotta have it in family functions (Whoosh)\nTry pull up but them man blundered\nMust have thought man's ting weren't one hundred\nWould you really risk it?\nTen times in the AMPR in the same week (Would you really?)\nIt's a '13 plate but it comes up as a '015 A3 (Neoww)\nRemember nan try say that I'm lazy\nLittle did she know that my work rate's brazy\nCah the light's yellow like Lauren London and the dark one brown like Kelis (Baow)\nI was homeless 'til I met Paddy, one of each, now [?] both happy\nI don't give a shit how I look when I'm trappy\nMan clinged up some Rizla bubs in trackies\nDouble H mad slappy, I see him put 150 on a bally (Woi-oi)\nMan do it in style\nHe said he might ride, he ain't done it in a while (Boo)\nSnub nosed up semi-auto's\nI was on the wing doin' [?] on zonal's (Ooft)\nFlick shank in my school clothes\nBG got it with my [?]\nMe and them man there ain't cool bro\nI build blocks, I don't know about [?]\nMan don't French kiss, I ain't from Bordeaux\nMad gyal, you must be talking [?]\n[Chorus]\nJust moved three box of the loud off my Snapchat (Ah)\nThinkin' back (Huh), dunno why I had my shank in my backpack\nShoulda had it on my waistline, through the grapevine, I heard them man rap cap (Cappin')\nMan trap and walkin' machines, the shotters and shooters gimme the clean, that's fact-facts (Baow)\n\n[Verse 2]\nDone 365 days in the bando, same way I done the same amount in the jailhouse (Huh?)\nFirst track, I can't get bail now, [?] I ain't sendin' no mail out (Brrt)\nTold bro that them funny youts played and my dargs pull up, 50, bring the tape out\nMan just rev up the vehicle, [?] rise copper and make them boy there fade out\nDeuce in a commercial rave\nBig .44 in the yardie motion (Hmm)\nMan pull up like, \"What's the commotion?\"\nMan ain't cuffing, man rising, I'm boastin'\nProduce and don't shoot? You must be smoking, joke ting (Huh)\nNeutral down the hill, man's rolling\nTrue say, I heard that the man's patrolling\nMight switch my spot to American bando\nB, this [?] for the letterbox\nAt least that way the cats won't be waitin' around on the road and man's never off\nCash didn't know how to let it off\nHad to bareback the gyal on the main road, had the big man just jettin' off (Woi-oi) (Baow)You might also like3Embed"

(What?)\nI'ma let you know from now TT's considerably more, so there's no disagreements (Quick, quick)\nAnd Jodie ain't scored all day\nShe's a regular, I can't believe she's out there cheating (Huh?)\nBut I don't care now and she wants to be let off a pound, man, I can't complete it (No)\nThere's no deals (Lil' bitch)\nI got the magic bricks, I'm the drug doctor\nNever ran off on him 'cause my plug proper (Yeah)\nIf you want any bitch, you can just holla (Brr)\nI now accept Bitcoins and I love dollars (Quick bricks)\nI break it down for you bros, tens and twenties\nI don't tick, don't phone me until the P's ready (Don't)\nAt Christmas time while everyone's merry with family\nI was doing calls with a penny\n\n[Chorus]\nI'll take you to the bando shop (What?)\nI'll let you lick the sales I got\nANPRs on the M, it's hot (Skrr)\nSo don't smoke 'til we hit the spot (Whoa)\nOutta town, that's Bajan rock\n1 to 2 from this weight I got\nI'll have you spending all your prof' (Haha)\nRinging my phone when you wanna cop', whoa\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nJakes wanna watch what we do (Preeing)\nAnd where we move, are we sharing food, or preparing yutes\nIf you rob this pack, don't declare it's you\n'Cause when we come back, it's a scary move (Finish him)\nWhip it for me baby, nice and fast\nMake sure you scrape the crumbs from the edge of the glass\nLock the door, grab my shank when I step in the trap\nIf the feds raid bro, I'll be tellin' my cat (Meow)\nBut let me show how it actually is\nHand to hand, Talibans, got a passion for it\nShe don't like the trap, told my new gyal, \"I'm legit\"\nNew stoner, the kitty wants a sample of it\nWell hang on a bit, you done that? I ramp on a bitch\nAdd the magic, twenty tonne stamped on the brick\nNo electric in the house so the candles are lit\nBroke times I couldn't afford a fancier bitch, now\nIf she got a devil face, I snap, she a freak (Nympho)\nI ain't got no fetish for feet (No), got a fetish for whippin' and glizzies with beams (Baow)\nSwitchin' the Glocks, make it sing and repeat (Da, da, da)\nSendin' Bitcoins to the plug, he textin' me, say he didn't receive (What?)\nDamn, you didn't receive? You gotta be k-k-k-k-kiddin' me\n\n[Chorus]\nI'll take you to the bando shop (What?)\nI'll let you lick the sales I got\nANPRs on the M, it's hot (Skrr)\nSo don't smoke 'til we hit the spot (Whoa)\nOutta town, that's Bajan rock\n1 to 2 from this weight I got\nI'll have you spending all your prof' (Haha)\nRinging my phone when you wanna cop', whoa\nI'll take you to the bando shop (What?)\nI'll let you lick the sales I got\nANPRs on the M, it's hot (Skrr)\nSo don't smoke 'til we hit the spot (Whoa)\nOutta town, that's Bajan rock\n1 to 2 from this weight I got\nI'll have you spending all your prof' (Haha)\nRinging my phone when you wanna cop', whoaEmbed"

Pickin' yutes at random\nThen, man went to the wok' house\nSweep up the landin'\nPart 2\n\n[Intro]\nAy CZR, you did a mazza still\nYo\nNorth West, Brum town\nJailhouse mandem bang your doors\nThe Voice of the Streets\nYo, yo\nTraphouse Mob\n\n[Verse]\nIf it ain't a public outin'\nI'll be in OT in some fucked up outfits\n'019, I put rips in trousers\nI thought it was, said the drip's outstandin'You might also likeEmbed"

(Lagga, lagga)\nIf you've been shot or stabbed and you still ain't rid, bro please don't @ me (dickhead)\nI'd take my two feet and walk up, no ding dong, man do it in a taxi\nIf your fam did an A-road ting, man's gripsing at aunts and aunties\nMan still went up if it's local deals, like 5 in a dark's buy candies (true)\nI'm scared of the big issue smokers and all that, the jakes sit down and watch them (preeing)\nMy phone did pop and I'm now in this uptown centre, there's no other option (brrr)\nMost of them man wear ballies should've shook and they don't want the mandem to clock them (true)\nYou ain't mashed no works, you ain't sold no drugs, just take off the mask you knobhead\n\nIn cunch local yutes get ahead of themselves, like they really live this life\nIn Brum not a day goes by that there's no shooting or the use of a kitchen- (ching)\nI'm just clocking why them man are hating, his (?) got victimised\nThe mandem are saying I'm gone, I'm not, I can still bitch some guys\nIf any man says I'm not out here, then that's a lie and your mom's gonna send (suck ya mum)\nImagine if I had 100 waps and unlimited links to the runts in the ends\nI'd be handing the kids them sweets like the ice cream man when he comes to the ends\nNow I get spotted by fans, it's- it's harder to blend\nFunerals, christenings, weddings, I can count on double H to more than have it\nMe, I can't lie on pranks, sike, blue tick and still man brang it (haha)\nGang unit behind, don't panic, I'm not a gang member, I'm a trapper that slapped it\nMan out 'ere flipped the switch, and the 'matic auto-mode might hit the bitch and khalas it\n\n[Chorus]\nIn Nairobi it's 'Wagwan' or 'Jambo'\nCooling in Kibera slums, 2 dracos and 13 rambos\nTo all the cats dem out here, at the end of the day, there's no food at the Nando's (lock arff)\nIn the dark's when the shots start beating\nSee the badman do cartwheels and gambles (lagga, lagga)\nIn Nairobi it's 'Wagwan' or 'Jambo'\nCooling in Kibera slums, 2 dracos and 13 rambos\nTo all the cats dem out here, at the end of the day, there's no food at the Nando's (lock arff)\nIn the dark's when the shots start beating\nSee the badman do cartwheels and gambles\nYou might also like[Outro]\nYou know what it is, bro, it's like 'rah'\nIt's like everyone's looking at me like I'm the way out, you get me\nMy nan, aunties, my mom, you see me\nThe mandem, cousins, you get me, it's like\nEveryone's thinking, yo\nIf man just put some energy into my man's ting\nAnd he gets thru, then we can get thru, you get me\nSo it's a lot of weight on man's shoulders\nLike, man's got man that man call uncles and that\nAnd their whole life is just coming out\nIt's like rah, saying, yo, this yute's gon' get man thru\nEven if it's not music, you get me, there's other little avenues that man can, you see me\nSo, yeah man, it's just how it is, like I got yutes man's age, younger, they're just starting their bird now, 30 years, you get me\nIt's like, rah, if I don't- if I don't ensure that everybody's in a better position, or you get me, better off\nThen I've failed my mission, innit?\n10% make it out, innit?Embed"

   "lyrics": "Daily Duppy Lyrics[Beat 1: Produced by BKay, Co-Produced by Yoshi & Zi Vocals]\n\n[Intro]\nYo\n\n[Verse]\nWith my YG, what's poppin'?\nStop it, he don't wanna talk, just knock it\nIf I put one hand behind, just cock it\nAnd shoot through your pockets, so nobody clock it\nBut watch it, hella civilians watchin' (Rah, it's BKay, una)\nAnd won't mind turnin' you in for a profit (Free)\nAnd just 'cause Provisional License's droppin'\nDon't think I won't get the drop and drop it (Kill it)\nWelcome back to my YouTube channel\nToday is smash or pass on waps (Wha')\nGet my subscribers up then I'll do part two\nSmash or pass on yats\nBut anyway, they say the .44 can't jam\nSo I think I'll smash\nAnd I'll smash the .12 gauge even though it's long\nAnd I gotta use two hands\nYou probably think 'cause it's waps, it's smash, smash\nBut a pass if they're known to jam\nLike the .8mms, dead, pass\nI'll give the one pop to the juvvies but pass\nBrownin' loud and thick, smash\nG-lock with no chick, pass\nAnd I'll still take the Glock with no chip, you're mad\nDon't like me then suck your dad (Your father)\nEv\u0435ryone's usin' the croc' emoji\nBut who's r\u0435ally got chopper teeth?\nTee had a link for a next chopper piece\nSo I phone big cuz for a one chopper, sweet\nJust to see if that one chopper beats\nBy now, you must know what chopper means\nClip black, but the stock mahogany\nIt is what it is if you know what I mean (Wha')\nAnd I'm still tryna find corn\n'Cah them things come rare like the lottery and the (Boyoi)\nBroom gets full up with dust 'cah too sweep up a room properly\nTo stay in the flat, have to pay one of each\nNow, this year, I'ma invest property\nGyal wan' read me like biography\nBut the articles don't fit this magazine (Haha)\nConsigned a 3.5, just startin'\nTryna make the best out a bad situation (Trappin')\nThought I knew how to chop, but I made bare crumbs\nSo I made 20 shots from a 8th ting (Off top)\nMade the cat run the phone, I was stupid\nSendin' him out when I'm in education\nNow, I'm licking shots without bein' on the field\nLike football manager doing simulation\nI cut the feds emergin' from the sideroad\nThey didn't need to do no hazard perception (Skrr)\nYou'd get bail and I'd go jail, me and you\nWe've got two different hazard perceptions (What)\nConfirm a name on a tape recordin'\nAfter that, I don't answer a question (No comment)\nNo Co-D's and I'm playin' duress\nAnd I got my shank for protection\nI came out of jail, shopkeeper askin' where I've been\nI said I've been away with work\nLittle does he know, eighteen months prior\nI was going through evidence, paperwork\nTelling my girl at the time it's long\nBut she's saying we can make it work\nTruck box gettin' caught in the AM\nJust to be told that my case adjourned\nThem green tunas, 1.29\nMan don't consume tuna in brine\nMatter of fact, I'm a mackerel man\nFor that fish there, costs 1.75 (Expensive)\nThis bally blocks my peripheral vision\nAnd I can't see the jakes from the side of my eye (Pissed)\nI'm still looking for cameras in prison\nI'll catch him lacking, the spot where it's blind (Ching)\nSee my mom's friends on the road\nAnd are asking me if I still kick ball (Ha)\nYeah, aunty, I just play semi-pro\nI'm just waiting now for that one big call (Ahaha)\nTrap or the pitch, yeah, I would've picked sports\nBut the cats on the strip paid me a bit more\nSo unless you're coming with quids\nYour freebie phone calls definitely getting ignored\n[Beat 2: Produced by JM-00 & Ghosty]\n\n[Verse]\nBro, if you see a white ST on your travels\nRight down the reg., I gotta clone them plates\nBut if the owner gets a speedin' ticket in a random town\nI'm gonna phone them jakes (Bait)\nFive men in a three door\nIt might be difficult to blow this chase (Skrr)\nIf you don't shake them first five minutes\nI'm gonna decamp and host a race (Usian)\nI've got my diamonds on in a club\nBut still, I ain't tastin' Ace of Spades\nI've gotta protect my Creps\nThese ain't normal Jordan's, these J2k\nDon't jack the wrong black man\nEnd up pickin' up five from my agent gauge\nYou're a joker without no heart\nI use my last card just to make this play (Brr)\nWhy's your girl gotta snap in her bio?\nFor a nigga like me to add and dougle\nI'm the man your mom thinks is calm\nShe won't ever know that I'm causing trouble\nBefore I knew about bricks, I was buryin'\n200 stones blazin' in the rubble (Oh my God)\nNow, I cut a lame bitch off like I'll hit you right back\nI'm just going through a tunnel (Ahaha)\nYou might also like[Beat 3]\n\n[Verse]\nSike, three semi twos, best friends\nNo pun intended, but it's worth a try\nOne got upset, bro called her a dyke\nMan, don't be rude, she's just young and bi\nMy bitch Dior from head to toe\nOn rodeo drive, and I'm wearin' Nike\nNiggas triggers be virgins\nDo it for the media, shootin' at the sky\nBetter mind, you don't hit that satellite\nI'm gonna be pissed if you switch off my sky\nNiggas saying I'm washed rude\nThey're just upset that I'm young and flyin'\nI don't speak on shit, but know what it is\nI don't care for the public eye\nBreak my tweezers in two\nUnscrew the fan, put my phone inside\nHella contraband in this vehic's\nBut only got done for this stolen ride\nThey found two phones and a bush, no prints on a line\nBut they know it's mine\nOne hour before in a tease\nSeeing Leeway putting stone on pipes (Lockoff)\nPaddy phone three times in an hour\nWhy don't you buy it all at once? It's long\nIf this old man sees me again\nHe's gonna report me to neighborhood watch\nCat drivin', I'm lying in the back\nTryin' not to get seen by the neighborhood cops\nI know I got the jakes in a foot chase\nCalm, I just gotta get away from the dogs\nI ain't got close friends on Insta\nAnything other than music's incriminatin' (Hot)\nHave you ever seen feds behind last minute?\nWanna drive straight, but you're already indicated (Pissed)\nI can tell he's gonna talk in a station\nHe's got a lot to say he's opinionated\nSign to 10% if you want a 9 bar, or a rap deal\nWe can facilitate it1Embed"

Ay, what, now?\nHONEYWOODSIX\nJevon\nYo, yo\n\n[Verse]\nThey say the only two outcomes from the street life is dead or in jail\nI respond the road ting's bigger than me\nIt's just bare gun smoke that I inhale\nBefore it was pending investigation\nI was underage, should of gave me bail (Real shit)\nGrowing up, nothing good in the city\nJust different murders in the Birmingham mail (True)\nSo how on earth do you expect me to show remorse or be any different? (How?)\nI come from poverty, yeah, I needed mon\u0435y\nInstead of helping me, th\u0435y sent me to prison (Dickheads)\nNiggas only wanna change\nWhen they get lifed off or in critical condition\nIn hood, if you ain't doing road\nThen it's be a footballer or be a musician\nNow everyting's changed\nThe ones that was lit, ain't it anymore\nI've been doing this for time\nDon't need no permission or street guarantor\nFrom when I used to like girls that wore Claude Boutique or Juicy Couture\nAin't got time for negative energy\nI feel like that then I'm gon' likkle more\nFresh home with a plan\nNot a grand to my name, never got no care pack\nI came out and niggas still broke with yutes\nHow the fuck are you havin' sex bareback? (How?)\nI used to hit up them bitches\nDM, they used to laugh and air that\nNow, look, couple years later\nTinted suburban, cuttin' through Fairfax (Skrrt)\n8AM, if I miss these cells in the other shottas\nAnd then my whole day's fucked (Brrt)\nOld times, runnin' out of toothpaste\nStick a knife in, make the Colgate buss (Ching)\nThem niggas actin' for the net\nNot being themselves, doin' roleplay stuff\nOne day is calm, next day is movin'\nHella quick, musta been the cocaine rush (Cap)\nHit the trap, save every penny\nDon't get caught in the hype, it's as simple as that\nBut girls in jewels love to get in the way\nNiggas get sidetracked, that's the issue\nIn fact, I'm tryna get Ray to drop off a parcel\nThe nitty downstairs came bringin' a pack\nNow, I can't get a job in the office with a criminal record\nBecause there's a stigma attached (Damn)\nI take losses, and keep goin' harder\nWhatever the weather, nevertheless\nIf you watch another man grindin' with jealous eyes\nThen you will forever be stressed (True)\nI'ma teach daughter from early\nDon't take second best, never settle for less\nI said only ten make it out\nThese brass niggas wish it was twenty percent\n[Part 2]\n\n[Verse]\nTold the man soldier \"Come work for me\"\nNo biggie, I'll give you a signin' on fee\nHalf an hour to cunch\nBut to serve this station, stressed, am I ridin' on E? (Skrrt)\nOnly tick paddy out, one of each\nI don't know why the fuck he's hidin' from me (Huh)\nStill punch him up for the cause\nWhat you think this is? finna style with my P's\nI'm still doin' road in the pandemic\nNo days off, I'm an essential worker\nIt's like a signal shit, it's fucked\nNo bars, need to switch off the network server (Switch it up)\nSeen a nigga with his hand in his pouch\nNo hits though, tryna pretend it's a burner\nThis yute's only got his provisional license\nHe still hits the cell, just drive on a learner\n\n[Part 3]\n\n[Verse]\nI remember I couldn't get girls\nAnd if I snap house party di gyal ah go turn up\nSkeng, done a big man from 9 now\nWhen I want re-boot you don't want to serve us (Ah)\nDon't go on the net and firm up\nWhen you see man inna flesh you firms us (Ha ha)\nThink you're safe in yard tryna cut through\nGet your head slap tryna que at the jerk hut (Baow)\nHold up wait (Wah?)\nIt's the spinner for me\nDon't look too loung you might trigger the Gs\nDouble H1 drive so I fling him the keys\n(Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt) Ay\nDon't bring them bait hoes, they might bring in disease\nThis top tight, can you see the stick in my jeans?\nNeed a fat pussy gyal and the vision complete, I mean\nYou might also like[Outro]\nYo\n(I'm ready, come get me)\nAlright then, say nothin'\nI'm just patternin' my bag and I'm leavin' out\n(Hurry up, I'm waitin')\nSay nothin'2Embed"
