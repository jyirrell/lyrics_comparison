  "plain": "Marvin William Bailey (b. March 4th 1994), professionally known as Fredo, is a rapper and entrepreneur hailing from Mozart Estate, Harrow Road in Queen\u2019s Park, West London.\n\nHe was noted as being a prominent figure in the Harrow Road Boyz gang based in West London. Taking on a raw flow & style in his music, reflecting on his drug dealing, criminal lifestyle and poverty-based background, Fredo has become one of the most exciting and crucial parts of the UK music scene.\n\nFredo burst onto the scene in January of 2016 with his first song \u201cThey Ain\u2019t 100\u201d. Going to prison just three-weeks later, it was whilst he was sat in jail that the track started to blow up with various radio play, racking up millions of views on YouTube and becoming a notorious street-anthem that\u2019ll eventually put him on the map. Inspired to see where his music could take him, after beating his charge, he seemed to have found his calling. He struggled in leaving the street life behind him and ended up in prison for the second time for a firearm charge. It was in prison where he announced his first mixtape Get Rich Or Get Recalled, which dropped on the 17th of March 2017.\n\nFredo\u2019s second mixtape Tables Turn dropped on the 9th of February 2018. The project had his return anthem \u201cChange\u201d, and stand-out single \u201cRappin' & Trappin'\u201d. The mixtape peaked at Number 5 on the UK Charts and is certified Silver. He also had a leading feature alongside Young T & Bugsey on Stay Flee Get Lizzy\u2019s debut single \u201cAy Caramba\u201d, giving him his first taste of chart success, landing on the UK Top 40 at Number 36.\n\nBefore 2018 had ended, Fredo featured on South London rapper Dave\u2019s hit-single \u201cFunky Friday\u201d which went on to become a commercial success, debuting at Number 1 on the UK Charts \u2013 becoming Fredo\u2019s first as well as the first song by a British rapper to reach the top position, serving as a significant moment for British rap music.\n\nThird Avenue served as Fredo\u2019s debut studio album and came out on February 1st 2019. The lead singles for this album featured tracks \u201cBMT\u201d and \u201cAll I Ever Wanted\u201d. The album peaked at Number 5 on the UK Charts.\n\nThroughout the rest of 2019, Fredo dropped a string of singles and features, including a big collaboration with Birmingham rapper MIST on the track \u201cSo High\u201d, which peaked at Number 7 on the UK Charts. Fredo also dropped his single \u201cNetflix and Chill\u201d which entered the UK Top 20 Charts and featured on Stay Flee Get Lizzy\u2019s party banger \u201c2 Cups\u201d with Tory Lanez and Popcaan. Fredo dropped his highly anticipated Daily Duppy in August 2020.\n\nOn the 20th of January 2021, Fredo announced his sophomore studio album Money Can\u2019t Buy Happiness, which was released on the 29th alongside the singles \u201cBack to Basics\u201d and \u201cMoney Talks\u201d with Dave, which debut at Number 2 on the UK Charts.\n\nIn April 2021, Fredo made a huge business venture as he announced a mutli-million pound investment into UK sneaker chain Kick Game, becoming a partial owner. In June 2021, Fredo announced his third studio album Independence Day, set to release in July of the same year."

The track marks Fredo\u2019s third collaboration with South London rap sensation Dave, who also produced this track and executively produced the album.\n\nOn the cut, Fredo and Dave go back-and-forth questioning their opposition, asking if the opps even deserve to be in the same conversation as the rap duo when they aren\u2019t even in the same tax bracket."

No\nCrazy bro, I was in jail, hearing me on the radio\nDidn\u2019t know if I would make it home but life is what you make it though\nEven though I\u2019m seein' this crazy money\nI know they want the crazy freestyle, they been waiting on me\nMy youngens sliding every night, yeah, they try daily duppy\nHundred 'round my neck and I won\u2019t let no one take it from me\n[Interlude]\nStraight in like that, yeah?\nAhh, let's go again\n\n[Verse 2]\nMade mistakes in my life and it needs a rewind\nBut then again, when I check these the reasons I'm out here\nWhen I was broke, they couldn't see me, them people was blind\nNow I\u2019m up, everyone seems to be seein' me fine\nBad on my own, they only move in a herd\nLast time I checked, pussy boy, you was a nerd\nWhistle on this new stick, is how we move on the curb\nLil' prick, we put the stick here on do not disturb\nMen lie, women lie but them numbers are real\nSo the opps must be lying \u2018cause their numbers are nil\nYou can\u2019t name one man that you done in the field\nBut you got hundreds of tracks, spittin\u2019 nothin\u2019 but drill\nAny time I\u2019m spittin\u2019, they know it\u2019s nothin\u2019 but real\nI\u2019m so lit, girls are always tryna come in some heels\nBut you look silly dressed up when you're just coming to chill\nI\u2019m tryna fuck you on the sofa then run up a mill'\nLittle Troy got a twenty, shit is fuckin\u2019 for real\nAnytime his Mum ask, I gotta cover them bills\nGot skills in the pot, whipped a hundred ml\u2019s\nNiggas start to think my left wrist must\u2019ve come from Brazil\nI done brought a couple man in to the party\nBut they ain\u2019t here to party\nYou play? Then they're coming to drill\nIf niggas think that I ain\u2019t gang no more and I\u2019m a rapper\nCome test me and you\u2019ll find out that I\u2019m one of them still\nTwo sticks in the whip, no bamboo\nEven Usain Bolt would lose track of all them hoes I ran through\nYou niggas doing loads, there\u2019s not much that I\u2019d do for hoes\nMost I bought a bitch was Hakkasan, and a Uber home\nI\u2019m doin' festivals, them man are doing tuna rolls\nWe're the teachers of the drip, gotta tutor loads\nLost my dargie and I know that he ain\u2019t coming back\nIf you lose your jewels by my dawgs, we don\u2019t run it back\nI swear it\u2019s hard to be a boss\nI just lost Muscle, I feel like part of me is lost\nIf I could, I swear I\u2019d probably have an argument with God\nI know you got your reasons, I\u2019m in my feelings, I don\u2019t understand\nDotz died before he even was a fucking man\nMy step dad caught an M, there ain\u2019t no coming back\nBut before this, I already was my brother\u2019s dad\nThat\u2019s how it goes when your people wanna fuck with crack\nThen the feds wanna send my niggas to pen\nWhen deep down, we all know the real villains is them\nWhy start taking crack? It just poisons estates\nI thought that people gotta live with all the choices they made\nWe don\u2019t force them to call, they been callin' for days\nAnd you can lock me up, cool, they\u2019ll just be calling my mates\nIt\u2019s safe to say, when shotters getting more than a rapist case\nHow can I abide by the law or what the labour says?\nI feel them guys in suits got all these laws tailor made\n'Cause they might touch a kid but they won't never touch a razor blade\nWhere I\u2019m from, there\u2019s not one, we had to make a way\nStarted with some fast food, the T is like a takeaway\nStraight from the block\nWe could go away for years\nAnd no one here can\u2019t be taking the spot\nCame from poverty so I bought a buss-down watch\nAnd a box before I ever thought about buying any property\nI gotta give it honestly, that\u2019s why my niggas honour me\nFeds might as well make a Instagram, how they follow me\nMy young niggas stab you up, you\u2019re dead, probably\n\u2018Cause they're walking 'round with machetes that\u2019s made for doner meat\nYo, they're actin\u2019, the love is just cheap\nAnd that\u2019s why that shit there don\u2019t mean nothing to me\nI\u2019m getting six figures now, just to go jump on a beat\nSo this my last freestyle \u2018cause I do nothin' for free\nYou might also like[Outro]\nYo S, you finessed this one, you know4Embed"

Been home all over a month and I ain't even gave them what they want just yet. Beat the cases. 12 try send me down the road rudeboi, but I'm home. Niggas ain't real like that. Free the gang!\u201c\n\n[Chorus]\nYou ain't real like that, you ain't real like that (No)\nYou should tell the truth, you ain't built like that (Never)\nSummer time so the roof peel right back\nI'm living luxury, and last month I was living up in custody\nNot police then these models want cuffs on me\nYou ain't real like that\nRiding with my day ones I'm in the field like that\nCan't phone for a ball I don't deal like that\n[Verse 1]\nYou ain't real like that, you ain't real like that\nMy brother been up in jail for years and I still write back (Yo)\nI'm on the block with the guys, man it's still like that (Like That)\nThey say I'm gonna blow but I still might trap (Might trap)\nYo I'm smoking on stardawg, my wrist cost a half-box\nDriving them foreigns, see police we park off\nCoz babes I'm a crook, I'll still show you what's good\nWe can go to The Shard or we can go to my hood (My Hood)\nI put ink on my skin, man I'm living in sin\nI give bro couple bags coz he lives in the bin (Bin)\nI'm boiling this water then dipping it in\nHalf a box in pebbles that's minimum cling (Sshh)\nSo light your weed up if you ever lost a close friend (Light)\nPour your yack if you'll do anything to hold them (Hold them)\nI'm coming from the bottom, teacher said I'm hopeless\nBut now I'm in a Benz, she's cruising in a Focus\n\n[Chorus]\nYou ain't real like that, you ain't real like that (No)\nYou should tell the truth, you ain't built like that (Never)\nSummer time so the roof peel right back\nI'm living luxury, and last month I was living up in custody\nNot police then these models want cuffs on me\nYou ain't real like that\nRiding with my day ones I'm in the field like that\nCan't phone for a ball I don't deal like that\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nThey say keep your friends far and your enemies close\nBut it's hard to really who's your friend on these roads\nFam it's so real I told the label I don't even know still\nCoz a couple years ago I signed up to a coke deal (Done)\nAnd If I stopped getting in the work, how would the road feel (How?)\nBut fam I like this music\nTurning up at shows with my niggas, fam I like to do it\nPut your phones in the air, this is Lyca music (Lyca music)\nIt's summer time she just wants to have fun and smoke some weed\nTold her if she tryna roll, come and roll with me\nMy shoes costs a lot but I get them Os for cheap\nI'm overseas in Dolce jeans\nI sat down and learnt how to cook from older G's\nNow I'm sitting in the trap smoking potent weed\nAnd the neighbours they know it's me\nSo I gotta keep 'em real nice so they don't phone police\n\n[Chorus]\nYou ain't real like that, you ain't real like that (No)\nYou should tell the truth, you ain't built like that (Never)\nSummer time so the roof peel right back\nI'm living luxury, and last month I was living up in custody\nNot police then these models want cuffs on me\nYou ain't real like that\nRiding with my day ones I'm in the field like that\nCan't phone for a ball I don't deal like that\nYou ain't real like that, you ain't real like that (No)\nYou should tell the truth, you ain't built like that (Never)\nSummer time so the roof peel right back\nI'm living luxury, and last month I was living up in custody\nNot police then these models want cuffs on me\nYou ain't real like that\nRiding with my day ones I'm in the field like that\nCan't phone for a ball I don't deal like that2Embed"

The gang's sliding out right this second\nLife ain't a game, guns in the range\nNone of my niggas don't fight with Tekken\n[Verse 1]\nYo, I need to find a reverend\n'Cause I live a life of crime\nAnd when it comes to my time to die\nI might not be able to find the heaven\nViolate? That night we get 'em\nCan't trust guys, change like the weather\nOcean water, diamond treasure\nI see your drip, but mine is wetter\nKing of the streets, I\u2019m still in the chair\nFuck you haters, I\u2019m feelin' to swear\nShe like when I pull it and grip on her hair\nPull up on them in the whip of the year\nPull up on them in the whip of the year\nCuttin\u2019 'em off, my scissors are near\nBro caught a murder, he's still in the clear\nMy girl knows that I'm killing the rear, killing the rear\nSigned the papers and now I\u2019m a millionaire, a millionaire\nGirls say \"I'm unreal\" but girl, I'm as real as your hair\nStill in the hood 'cause my niggas are there\nLotta hate that I feel in the air\nGuns in the show, yeah, we bring it in there\nNow I'm feeling prepared\n\n[Chorus]\nYo, she wanna Netflix and chill (Chill)\nBut I wanna get rich and build (Build)\nYo, look at my left wrist, it's real (Real)\nShe know it ain't right but left with me still\nI'm so high, my head in the hills\nA kilo of crack's a hell of a meal\nAll of my junkies getting the bill\nThem niggas rap, but never the real, never the real\nMy girl said she'll leave but never she will, never she will\nAnd if she leaves me, I have feelings I'll never reveal, never reveal\nNiggas touch me? The gang's sliding out right this second\nLife ain't a game, guns in the range\nNone of my niggas don't fight with Tekken\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nYo, I think I'd like to mention\nWhen Fred was broke and starved\nI felt like all of my hope was up\nI couldn't find you guys for helping\nIt was love when, riding sentence\nThey'll be mad when you, buy the Bentley\nPussy tight, can't find the entry\nBut it's mine, and I slide in plenty\nMan, we used to throw pounds at the edge of the wall, I'm talking the edge of the wall\nMy teachers was looking for me and my niggas but we wasn't never in school\nNow I make pounds at the end of a call, who would have thought that Fred would ball?\nJumped in the game, I ain't read the rules\nWhen jail niggas phone, I accept the calls\nYou should know how I'm feelin' today\nI hit the trap, fuck a minimum wage\nIf I didn't rap, I'd be still in the cage\nWe ain't close, so she's feelin' a way\nTold my dawg, \"We're big in the game\"\nYou kill the opps, I kill the game\nVisit my show, don't go stealing no chains\n'Cause the industry's quick to be feeling a way\nShe's all on heroin, feelin' for veins\nSeein' that young, the feelin' is strange\nNew yard's big, I live in a maze\nLast week, I lost two of my women for days\nWhen we poked up shh, he was slipping away\nReal talk, he's lucky he's living today\nThese days, I can't even finish my plate\nSo it's only right my niggas ate\n[Chorus]\nYo, she wanna Netflix and chill (Chill)\nBut I wanna get rich and build (Build)\nYo, look at my left wrist, it's real (Real)\nShe know it ain't right but left with me still\nI'm so high, my head in the hills\nA kilo of crack's a hell of a meal\nAll of my junkies getting the bill\nThem niggas rap, but never the real, never the real\nMy girl said she'll leave but never she will, never she will\nAnd if she leaves me, I have feelings I'll never reveal, never reveal\nNiggas touch me?

Now they missing\n\n[Verse 2]\nBro I'm about to and about to kill it\nIs best you pour some Yack and then you bill it\nSitting in the trap with 9 and a midget\nGoing to press it first then I'm going to whip it\nHold on\nWait a minute\nI'm about to flip it\nI was chilling in the trap I had to pivot\nI heard a knock at the door, it was suspicious\nI got more work in the house then the [misses]\nEvery other day I do the dishes\nI put it in the microwave for a minute\nThen I bring it out and all I see is fishes\nI send my jail G's P's\nI go on visits\nYou might also like[Hook]\nWhipping whipping whipping in the kitchen\nI told my little nigga that he really got to listen\nI don't wanna see you back in prison\nPlus my new TrapSpot yeah it's kicking\nYeah it's kicking\nThey just breathing but we living\nI told you that my life is kind of different\nAnd free my fucking brother cause I miss him\nOne minute they was here...

Well, I can demonstrate (Freddy)\nYoung nigga blowing up the flat, I detonate\nGlass AP has shattered my wrist, needs a rest today\nI got a way with words\nAny black yutes in ****, man will make it burst\nNo white yutes, my G, we're going on some racist works (Hah)\nIn '016, I got my first music project placed on Earth (Earth)\nBut on the opp-block, I taped it first (First)\nI think I'm made of her\n'Cause she's an animal lover, my jacket's made of fur\nSometimes I can't believe just what I made off words\nStill, I ain't cuttin' from the opps\nNiggas know that Fred will run for mayor first\nLittle man, I need a 40 just to lay a verse\nBaby girl's mad I move, but that's how a playa work\nThe plug lost trust, now I gotta pay him first\nTook food off hella man, now he won't even take my word (Take my word)\nBut still time is tickin' (Tickin')\nMy girl got a good brain, you know her mind's the sickest (Sickest)\nBut at the same time, she won't ever mind her business (Business)\nTold my guys, when they slide, bear in mind the witness\nYo, my lady woke up with bruises, tryna find who did it\nSilly girl, you must not realize how my diamonds hittin'\nLast night you could've easily lost your sight or vision\nI believe in God, so you can say I'm kind of Christian\nBut going Hatton Garden every Sunday's my religion (Forever)\nYou was up in college, pussy boy, go write and listen (Nerd)\nI was outside the plug's doing my revision (Facts)\nBaby girl, you're not my main, you're my side addition (My side piece)\nSo I'm gonna need some \"shh\" when the wife is ringin' (Ringin')\nNiggas gotta keep the \"shh\" 'cause my ice is blingin' (Blingin')\nGot a suttin' with the \"shh\", do a silent drilling (Drilling)\nYeah, I poked up, \"shh\", cah I don't like them niggas (Pussies)\nYou think I read comments?\nI'm a bad boy with street problems\nAP, Patek, and a Rolex, I keep options (Options)\nFifty thousand for a festival, I keep shottin'\nCatch me countin' twenty in the morning while I eat porridge\nBaby girl, you look good, let me see suttin'\nI was stuck up in the hood, had to be suttin'\nNiggas show respect in the place when my teams comin'\nI'll shop when I get to the place, I don't need luggage (Don't need luggage)\nI got your girl on top of me, I don't need covers (No)\nIt's bicarbonate soda up in these cupboards\nI get emotional every time I see hundreds\nGonna make my eyes water when I'm choppin' these onions\n[Outro]\nReal shit\nMake my eyes water when I'm choppin' these onionsYou might also like4Embed"

There's a million ways\nGot my knife every day 'cause I'm still in my ways\nYo, this rap weren't never the plan\nI'm cool but never a fan (Never)\nNot havin' money don't make no one less of a man\nBut you need money to be the best that you can\nIf I go broke, I'll go rest in the can\nBump into opps and I'm reppin' the gang\nYoung little teenagers steppin' for man\nThat man ain't got no bodies but reckon they're bad (How?)\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nFeds on my back\nThey think I'm the head of the gang\nCouple G's on the road\nGot the rest of the bros in the can (Free 'em)\nCouple hundred in drug P's, put the rest of the P's in the bank (Put that away)\nKilos of petrol up in the bando and the rest in my tank, yo\nWe got it, there's no wrestlin', man\nWho's gonna wrestle with man? (Who?)\nShe said I'm out here fuckin' everybody\nWho's gonna settle with that? (Hmm?)\nCookin' tuna in my cell\nUsed to use kettles for that\nSince I ran up half a million, pussy, I never been better\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe been livin' a way, fly out the cunch, give it away\nNext thing you know, the phone's on the drib in a day\nThat's how I done it, it's really the way\nI shot the glass from whippin' the yay\nLost it, was my biggest mistake\nGave Delma some food, he went missin' away\nHe must've thought up in the prison he safe\nBiggest mistake\nMy niggas ran in the cell and slit in his face (Gang)\nThis ain't rap, it's really the case\nRevenge is so sweet, it's really the taste\nEveryone knows me, the feelin' is strange (Strange)\nDark tint when I chill in the Range (Range)\nBro got locked, years in the cage\nEvery day's the same, so I give him a change\nYo, I worked so hard to be real\nBut them lies that they make ain't harmin' me, still (Never)\nGot a yout' strapped up in the party to kill\nHe knows make his own way home if he's barkin' it still\nMy army is real\nTwenty years if he pleads, that's hardly a deal\nMan, it's awkward now\nI don't even know what we should talk about\n[Chorus]\nYou must be havin' weird dreams of walkin' out (Ah)\nYou don't need kebab shops for no quarter pounds\nJust phone Little Capo, he'll sort you out\nMy niggas ride, don't talk it out\nHanger in the pot, fork it out\nUsed to have to stay at my shorty's house\nNow my left wrist is a mortgage house\nYou know what's funny as well? (What?)\nBefore I met Santan Dave\nI met his brother in jail\nI never knew and his brother didn't tell (For real?)\nWho would've thought me and his brother would sell?\nNumber one in the charts\nI used to be number one in the dark, dark\n\n[Verse 3]\nDoubtin' myself was my biggest mistake\nTrustin' someone was also my biggest mistake\nWe started as dargs, but he finished a snake\nCan't run 'round there to slither away\nI'm into money, ain't into debates\nWith my knife on ****, watch niggas deflate\nThe quicker I leave, the bigger the chase\nSo girl, don't play, give a nigga your face\nI paid my lawyer, I'm winnin' the case\nFeds took fifty, still had a grin on my face (Huh)\nPercs, I got dribs in the safe\nThink I'm out with all the shit that I made\nGive a nigga a break\nEvery dog has his day, but it isn't today (Nah)\nFree my dargs that's still locked in the cage\nReminiscin' on their biggest mistake (The biggest)\n\n[Chorus]\nI still remember the first wetting\nFilled up with hype and adrenaline\nGave the yout' a little leggin'\nNext time was a face shot, progression\nMy youngin got life, stressin'\nWonderin' if we'll forget him\nBack then for six racks, get 'em\nNow times that by ten just for renting\nIt ain't 'bout the start, it's the endin'\nIt ain't 'bout your heart, it's the weapon\nThis music just came as a blessin'\nAfter all of the rain and the lessons\nPromoters, they pay for my entrance\nThese people, they pay for a sentence\nRobbed the plug, never meant it\nMy biggest mistake, I left it\n\n[Outro]\nCan money buy happiness?\nNo, money can't buy happiness\nBut it can contribute towards gettin' happiness\nI mean, you can't go into the shop and purchase a bottle of happiness\nIt just doesn't work like that\nThere's not, like, a single thing that you can identify as happiness\nAnd say you're gonna have money and get that\nThere's so much more5Embed"

    "plain": "Independence Day Freestyle was dropped as a surpise with no promotion on the 6th of May, and serves as the first track by West London rapper Fredo following his critical and commercially acclaimed sophomore studio album Money Can\u2019t Buy Happiness released in January 2021.\n\nThough unconfirmed, Fredo dropped a cryptic message of \u201cIndependence Day is coming\u201d \u2013 which was thought to be the teased collab mixtape with Church Road, North London rapper Nines. On the 24th of June, Fredo announced his third studio album Independence Day, set to be released in July 2021.\n\nGoing back to his patented expensive flow, Freddy details his former life of being poor, a drug dealer and gangbanger whilst also issuing a warning to his opp\u2019s as he \u201cstill has ties with the streets\u201d. In contrast, also boasts about his newfound millions and brazenly raps about his multi-million pound diamond chains and watches. This is Fredo back in his element."

       "plain": "Independence Day Freestyle was dropped as a surpise with no promotion on the 6th of May, and serves as the first track by West London rapper Fredo following his critical and commercially acclaimed sophomore studio album Money Can\u2019t Buy Happiness released in January 2021.\n\nThough unconfirmed, Fredo dropped a cryptic message of \u201cIndependence Day is coming\u201d \u2013 which was thought to be the teased collab mixtape with Church Road, North London rapper Nines. On the 24th of June, Fredo announced his third studio album Independence Day, set to be released in July 2021.\n\nGoing back to his patented expensive flow, Freddy details his former life of being poor, a drug dealer and gangbanger whilst also issuing a warning to his opp\u2019s as he \u201cstill has ties with the streets\u201d. In contrast, also boasts about his newfound millions and brazenly raps about his multi-million pound diamond chains and watches. This is Fredo back in his element."

I'mma listen and wait\nI bring so much food in this place, you'll never finish your plate\nWhere I'm from, I can't even lie, them prisons are fate\nBut it's a big mansion next time I live in them gates\nDrilling ain't jumping out the car and waving knives\nIf you man are drilling then why ain't you guys takin' lives? Baby guys\nI got big waps, no baby .9's\nGirl with big back giving uck 'til I got lazy eyes\nStro got nicked for his kidnap, but it made him wise\nThen he bucked the plug in jail and that really changed his life\nYo, I wouldn't lie, no there ain't no feeling like when bullets fly\nRunning on the other side, gang gang and my hoodie tied\nWondering if a pussy died when I'm getting back on ends\nHad some olders, pressured them, they ain't coming back again\nThey say that life's priceless can't put a price on that\nBut if the price is right, you'll die, I'll put my guys on that\nFly to Dubai I'm with the same guys, it's a crazy setting\nMore foreign cars lined up here than in an Asian wedding\nYeah my brudda's catching years, they ain't got a month\nEveryone sitting down, it's like I'm from a block of Monks\nHeard he's got a watch, but he don't put in, watch us rob the punk\nBet that prezi won't even last as long as Donald Trump\nYo, new problems that I'm faced with when the guala come\nPicking out the Rollie or the AP, that's a common one\nLook at what you've gone and done\nYeah, I rap about them trap spots and all them times on the block\nBut, believe me, it wasn't fun\nEvery time I drop, just know I'm rising, akh\nIt use to be ten a show, now you can times it that\nA lot of man stayed the same, I really find it sad\nForget rap 'cause I was lit up in my times of crack\nNah, I don't even draw I'm using words as art\nSo if I do draw that girl, then she's a work of art\nMum went up in my drawer, she found that work and dark\nCheck the score, it's not a draw, I'm from the dirty 'Zart\nCan you name another brudda out here rippin' these beats\nWith food sellin' on these roads, and drillers kill in these streets\nI can drop it, but there's also a delivery fee\nCame far from a damn nitty, no Sterling, it's Man City\nThey say I fell off, them man there are hella haters\nIf I fell off, must've fell off stairs into some elevators\nGot a young boy you can look at, tell he's hella dangerous\nThem man are talking, but my bruddas, we're the demonstrators\nYoung nigga's killing 'em, free my nigga Simion\nHe went to jail, I had a ten, when he's home I'll have some millions\nAnd everything is real rap, so everybody feel that\nHow can them man try step on my toes when they're steel cap?\nIt's a roadman trackie when I glide in the street\nNo, I don't even own a suit 'cause all my ties in the street\nThem man hide and we seek, I put the grind on repeat\nTen tonne pressed aside down like reclining a seat\nYo, I hate when I hear rappers talkin 'bout pressing and mixing\nSame pussy cappers never even stepped in a kitchen\nUse to run it up in crackheads 'til they get an eviction\nYeah, I made a lot of money due to stress and addiction\nWho's real? I use to do the nights for two bills\nNow I make sure my blocks straight before the news spill\nBefore all this rose gold, I really had a few steels\nNow the chain froze, watch froze, and I'm due chills\nI don't give a fuck about how you feel\nPut me on a beat like this, shit gettin' too real\nSaid it's no more freestyle, and that shit was true still\nBut if I don't go this hard, then tell me, who will?You might also like1Embed"

stacks off one number\nWhen you're at the pot, you can lose it all off one fuck up\n\n[Verse 1: Yxng Bane]\nFuck them, I don't know them, they ain't one hunna\nAll up on your crop half, fuck her yard don ah\nFuck them, I don't know them, they ain't one hunna\nStrapped up, strapped creps, nigga, that's Margiela\nHoppin' out the spaceship (Ah, yeah)\nSwagger's on eighty (Ah, yeah)\nProbably fucked your missus in a Uber so it's five star rating (Skrr, skrr)\nProbably in Givenchy's, swagger's out a scale, that's five star rating (Woo, woo)\nProbably having brekkie outta Michelin, that's five star rating, ayy (Ow, ooh)\nDrop the plug, we'll run it back (Ow, ooh)\nIn the suit and tie up bags (Ow, ooh)\nHave Fredo run it back (Ow, ooh)\nIt's a sket that suck me on the map (Ow, ooh)\nHigh road on Freemason\nBitch the baddest cause she blaze it\nShe ain't surf but she jump wavin'\nProbably hold a pack in the anus\n[Verse 2: Little Torment]\nChef whippin' up a German (Woo)\nTrap game, I had to learn it\nFuck a opp boy, I'm coppin' burners (Yeah)\nScummy nigga from the Southside\nBut I found a plug and got the earnin' (Scummy)\nI don't trust a soul, I don't trust your soul\nI don't trust them boy, they vermin\nIn and out of blocks, in and out of blocks\nIn and out the German servin' (Skrr)\nIn and out the kitchen, on and off the stove, wrists movin' like a whirlwind\nFuck a rapper, I'll spin the coupe round, spin the MAC and make your world spin\nLittle Torment had no respect from day, there was nothin' they could tell him\nKway Kway, that white girl with me (Yeah)\nAnd I got my baddest girl with me\nNice breasts, she spend your whole stack (Gone)\nIt's nothin', she just wanna rule the world with me (Left)\nI ain't round and make my tail with me\nAnd I keep a strap full of bells round me\nJust incase somebody tryna get rowdy\n(I don't fire use my gun, lowe me)\nLowe me, lowe me, I don't want a thirty\nPlus the washers flying with the TT dirty\nAmne' buddy, they can smell it on me\nI don't sell food, it sell itself for me\nNiggas corny, buyin' hoes shoes\nI buy Loubs, but I buy some straps too\nThis what happens when the realest niggas from the city link up, make a rap tune\nYou might also like[Bridge: Fredo & Nafe Smallz]\nYoung niggas gettin' street money 'til they lock me\nI got a white girl with a big back, she talks Cockney\nThey see the kid and they skate out, it's not hockey (Skrr, skrr)\nKeep the dots in the gym bag, true, it's stocky (Lets go, lets go)\n\n[Verse 4: Nafe Smallz]\nWe keep the hammers in the duffle (Gone)\nSo run your mouth and you in trouble (Baow)\nMy doggy rollin' with the muzzle\nWe gotta keep this shit one hundred (Woah)\nProbably got us on the OBBO\nThey addin' pieces to the puzzle, yeah, yeah\nHit the trap and make it double cah nobody promised tomorrow (Nobody promised tomorrow)\nPrivate plug, yeah, I call the plug and I tell him what's up\nGet the pack and get it gone, I told them niggas I'm the one\nAll them bitches gonna come, I told them niggas \"Get the funds\"\n'Cause everybody wanna win and everybody wanna eat\nTell everybody in the slums, I told 'em see what I become\nI'm the type to skip the drama, burnin' bridges like I'm lava\nHit the strip or hit the corner, rollin' up some Marijuana\nRunnin speeches like Obama\nBring your bitch to the apartment\nShawty naked while she dancing (Naked)\nAll the food, the nigga starvin'\nSmokin' weed from early morning\nFuck that groupie if she borin' (Lets go, lets go)\n[Verse 5: Yung Fume]\nWhip, whip, whip, whip 'til it's hurtin' (Hurtin')\nSkatin' round in a foreign joint, this shit German (German)\nI got white boys, I got Polishes, I got Turkish\nThey phone the phone I got my Arab ting, man, she Persian\nPlug threw me a pack and served it (Served it)\nI got clientele, man they purchase\nRunnin' through the hundreds, trap jumpin' for the whole week\nA thousnad grams, man, that's a whole key\n28, that's a OZ (Woo)\n(No one taught me how to get a pack, go get that money, I go on my own feet)\n(I was dippin' out, now I'ma take a trip to Harrods, I'ma keep it lowkey) (Woo)\nI seen a bad bitch and she a hottie (I seen a bad bitch and she a hottie)\nPlug drop me bricks, I think I'm John Gotti, think I'm John Gotti, the plug\nI smoke that weed, I don't pop Molly\nI heard the popo are after me (After me)\nYou got them nines and half a piece\nF-fuck them, I don't know them, they ain't one hunna\nOT for like couple months, talkin' one supper (One supper)\nFuck tings, I don't cuff tings, not one lover (One lover)\nIt was me and bro in that fuckin' alley, it's the fuckin' gutter\n\n[Chorus: Fredo]\nFuck them, I don't know them, they ain't one hunna\nIn my German car, drop a big pack on my young gunner\nIn the trap, I make mad stacks off one number\nWhen you're at the pot, you can lose it all off one fuck upEmbed"
