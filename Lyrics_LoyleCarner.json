  "plain": "Benjamin Coyle-Larner, better known by the stage name Loyle Carner. His stage name was originally going to be Mowgli but became Loyle Carner because he suffers from dyslexia and would accidentally spell his name as Loyle-Carner not Coyle-Larner as a kid.\n\nLoyle Carner is a British rap music artist and actor from South London. His sound has been described by NME as \u2018sensitive and eloquent\u2019 and by The Guardian as \u2018confessional hip-hop\u2019. Loyle Carner has toured with the likes MF DOOM, Joey Badass and Kate Tempest and has also played at many UK festivals including Glastonbury. In October 2015 he played on Huw Stephens' BBC Radio 1 show as part of their Piano Sessions series."

Youth Choir]\nThe Lord will make a way\nThe Lord will make a way\nThe Lord will make a way\nThe Lord will make a way\n\n[Verse 1]\nUh, uh, look\nUh, no, I don't believe him\nUh, but know that I've been grieving\nKnow that I've been holding out, hoping to receive him\nI've been holding out for G but he was nowhere to be seen\nWhen I was bleeding\nCousin with the choking and the wheezing\nBut still he dream of smoking potent in the evening\nThis is only for the heathens\nHold until the souls who need redeeming from the demons\nStill ain't folded when it's freezing\nThere ain't no-one to believe in, I'm on that man side\nDamn right, doing it myself from a landslide\nStand by, didn't need no help from no damn guy\nMan by, I've been making waves all my damn life\nPlanned my step to the letter and I stand by it\nTry it, we ain't holding back if it backfires\nLax, not the ones who carry crack 'til their back tired\nThought they'd make a mil' 'til it transpired\nI ain't like them damn liars\nUh, I'm saying I ain't like them damn liars\n[Verse 2]\nTrust, told him I ain't like them damn liars\nSo keep your mouth closed shut\nEyes wide open when that doubt rose up\n'Cause if that drought shows nothing but the clouds hold\nNothing but the sound, I'll be running 'til the ground open up\n'Cause the best don't change, clinging to that whole one\nMy mother said, \"There's no love until you show some\"\nSo I showed love and got nothing, now there's no-one\nYou wonder why I couldn't keep in tow, son?\nI wonder why my dad didn't want me, ex didn't need me\nHalf of them left and the rest finna breeze me\nIt's blessed 'til I second guess, rest 'til it freeze me\nThere's nothing to believe in, believe me\n\n[Chorus: S.C.I. Youth Choir]\nThe Lord will make a way\nAnd when I get in trouble\nThe Lord will make a way\nI have the Lord by my side\nThe Lord will make a way\nAnd whenever I need him\nThe Lord will make a way\n\n[Verse 3]\nLittle bit of life after death\nScatter my ashes when it's my time for rest\nWith the lines I'm obsessed, rhymes I possess\nCan't deny, seen the biggest guys cry to confess in a breath\nFresh death passing the chest, unimpressed with the sess\nLeft scars in the flesh, he's the best, worst-kept sparring in jest\nSaying, \"Star never bar too far from the nest\"\nSo I never left and never thought about doing so\nI to-and-fro from that prime time to a home\nYou see, I'm doing those nights I should've known better\nLike whatever, still my breddas say I'm too involved\nBut who would know what the family first is?\n'Til you dream, see three family hearses\nWorst is, wanted me to speak at the service\nSo I penned a couple bars, didn't need to rehearse this\nYou might also like[Chorus: S.C.I. Youth Choir]\nThe Lord will make a way\nAnd when I get in trouble\nThe Lord will make a way\nI have the Lord by my side\nThe Lord will make a way\nAnd whenever I need him\nThe Lord will make a way8Embed"

    "plain": "\u201cDesoleil (Brilliant Corners)\u201d is Loyle Carner\u2019s self professed favourite track on the album.\nIt\u2019s reminiscent of his earlier songs but now he speaks with a new maturity and positive outlook, which is not only how the track sounds, but the general \u201cmise-en-scene\u201d of the song.\n\nSampha provides some vocals, creating a romantic and nostalgic juxtaposition with Loyle\u2019s fast lyrics.\n\nIn the track Loyle, describes growing up since the release of his first album, although still having to face the same struggles he always had. Now however, he has someone to face all of these struggles with. Someone to watch his back or, in Benjamin\u2019s words, \u201cmoisture his face when it\u2019s crusty\u201d.\n\nOn an Instagram Q & A, Loyle told of how this was the first track made for the album, and that they made it in one day, and the track was a \u201cbig deal\u201d."

Reminiscing over childhood and growth of her son Ben (Loyle\u2019s real name) and her struggle to replace the father role after the death of Loyle\u2019s stepfather.\n\nThis poem acts as a response to the first track \u201cDear Jean\u201d in which Loyle writes his own poem to his mother. In it, he reminisces about the past, talks about his girlfriend and tells his mother that he will soon move out of her place. However, he assures her that he will not be gone forever and that he\u2019s thankful and will always love her.\n\n\u201cDear Ben\u201d also features the same instrumentals als \u201cDear Jean\u201d, making clear that it\u2019s a response to it.\n\nLoyle\u2019s mother has previously performed a poem on \u201cSun of Jean\u201d on his album Yesterday\u2019s Gone."

Unique. Defiant. Uncompromising\nAnd with our compass lost, we talked long into the darkest hours\nUntil we saw the burnished sky, and our eyes stung as our words blurred and became thoughts\nAs we were silenced by the dawn\nWe clung to each other like sailors in a storm as our world pitched and bucked, our breath stolen by grief\nBut you stood strong, filled such big boots\nGripped to the helm and steered us on into the calm\nAbandoned your lifetime ambition, to hold us down\nTook on a different mission, while we were turned inside out, raw and gaping\nBut you wrapped us up in your dream, realised your vision and fed us with your words of pearl\nLike buccaneers, we sailed the seven seas and drank in the wonders of your world, and returned giddy with the heady smell of your success\nAnd when that time came, oh did we weep, but the tears that streaked our cheeks were stained with glee because we knew that this was not goodbye, that you'd be back, that you'd never really left\nBecause love does not lessen by miles it's not locked out by doors or walls, but reinforced in thought and heart\nIt cannot be lost like a key or a sock, or left behind in a box, it is present in each and every breath and flows deep with every beat and deed\nIt may not be your presence but it's your essence that remains. Forever dancing like glitter in our air\nAnd now it's as clear to me my beautiful boy, as naked as the joy that caresses the creases of your eye, that you've finally found your one, your golden snitch, and my task is done\nFor I've gained a daughter\nI've not lost a son\n[Spoken: Loyle Carner & Jean Carner-Loyle]\n[Loyle]\nMa, [sigh] you wait till Emily hears that, you wait till the world hears that, fuuuuuu-\n[Jean]\nDo you like it?\n[Loyle]\nIt's even better than the first one\n[Jean]\nOh my daysYou might also like2Embed"

It's weird, man\nEvery now and then like - I'm like playing and it's like \"what?\"\nI'm actually\n\n[Verse 1: Loyle Carner]\nI ain't seen you for a minute, wonder what for\nOnly really chilling when we're on tour\nEven then there's something different I feel unsure if you look at me and still believe I should've done more\nBefore your brothers on the top floor\nOr before another show is just a dumb chore\nWe'd lay awake at yours dreaming of an encore and laugh at all the things that we would say when we won awards\nCourse money was the source\nI've never known nothing like the force\nTo rip a bond apart, shred it out its course\nNow two best friends who shared the torch barely talk\nAnd if we do it's mostly money not remorse\nAnd yo, I know there's nothing funny 'bout divorce\nBut if this shit has really run its course\nI want you to know that all of mine's all of yours\nUh, all of yours\n[Bridge: Loyle Carner]\nStill remember your mum buying me the flat pack mattress?\nSleeping on your floor?\n\n[Verse 2: Loyle Carner]\nIt's supposed to be Ben and Krispy\nAnd anywhere I went I said I'd take you with me\nTour around the world and give a fuck, you'd miss me\nGet another city, yo, I cried when that sentence hit me\nBen and Krispy, 'til the feet stop\nReminisce like CL and Pete Rock or Blu and Exile 'cause every time the beat drop\nI start to tell a story and you follow with the beat box\nTell 'em, get up on your feet like the seats hot\nCommon and Dilla started spinning from the T tops\nBut Rebel B was all I need and all I see\nDrop the rythm on repeat and I would spit it 'til the beat stopped\nBut the beat stopped\nSo now what?\nYo, I can't wait another hour boss\nGive a fuck about the money or the e-track\nI Just Want my G Back\nTrust\nI just want my G back\n\n[Outro: Loyle Carner]\nAyo listen, I got a lot more to say but I reckon I leave this next bit blank, so you wanna write something, you can write something\nI love you, GYou might also like2Embed"

    "plain": "\u201cTierney Terrace\u201d is about the struggles of young Ben Coyle-Larner growing up with large family responsibilities after the death of his step-father.\n\nLoyle Carner told The Guardian,\n\nThat\u2019s the most difficult battle of it, because I can never replace my dad \u2013 but I can try my best to fill his shoes. Oddly enough, he had size 13 shoes, so I will never quite fill them, but I try my best.\n\nCarner wrote this song after a run in with his biological father. The title of the song is the name of his grandparents' house."

Oddly enough, he had size 13 shoes, so I will never quite fill them, but I try my best.\n\nCarner wrote this song after a run in with his biological father. The title of the song is the name of his grandparents' house."

Nah, of course we're not\nJust a couple steady snacks for the journey heading back\nFull of the sugar so our teeth Yes of course they rot\nSit for hours, sun, thunderstorm or showers\nIn that same living room watching the bloom turn to flowers\nThe night was ours\nSuperpowers and all\nWe were zapping out the window and watching the cowards fall\nHad it all\nPowerful, making me tower tall\nBountiful from something so small\nSo I'd rather take the fall and brawl\nBefore I drowned in what I found so cruel\nYou might also like\n[Bridge: Loyle Carner]\nSitting and sipping whiskey like my grandad did\nTrying to like the life that my grandad lived\n'Cos when the black man slipped into the darkness\nAnd the black man dipped\nIt didn't matter, had that love I left my grandad with\nSip brandy like my grandma do\nTrying to like the life that my nan told true\n'Cos if I run from you she'd hold my hands\nUntil my hands turn blue\nSo I pursue the new, thinking 'bout the man they grew, because\n\n[Hook: Loyle Carner] x2\nTrust, all I wanted was a fucking man\nTo tell the fucking truth, hold my fucking hand\nUh, to guide me through the darkness when the others ran\nInstead he was sliding and slipping I didn't understand\nI didn't understand-stand, didn't understand\nUh, now every time that motherfucker ran\nI didn't understand-stand, didn't understand\nUh, now believe me I need a fucking man2Embed"

I\u2019ve got a bigger part to play\nSo, when they ask me, it ain\u2019t hard to say, uh\n\n[Chorus: Kiko Bun]\nYou don\u2019t know, what I\u2019m looking for\nYou don\u2019t know oh, what I\u2019m looking for\nYou don\u2019t know, what I\u2019m looking for\nYou don\u2019t know oh, what I\u2019m looking for\nYou might also like[Verse 3: Loyle Carner]\nUh, uh, so why you crying?\nStop the crying, I weren\u2019t crying on you\nStop the lying, worry \u2018bout them brothers lying on you\nThey\u2019re sliding on you, bump \u2018n grind every night up on you\nGetting sly up on you, cry up on you, then get tired of you\nBawling \u2018cause I ain\u2019t on you, what the fuck you mean\nUh, closest to trust I ever seen\nWell shit, well there, I said it now, forget it like a dream\nNo regret, can\u2019t forget the shit you seen, shoulda kept it clean\nUh, you shoulda kept it clean\nCan\u2019t forget the shit you seen, you shoulda kept it clean\nTrust, uh, you shoulda kept it clean\nNo regret, can\u2019t forget the shit you seen, shoulda kept it clean\nUh, you shoulda kept it clean\nUh uh, you shoulda kept it clean\nUh, you shoulda kept it clean\nUh, \u2018nah mean?\n\n[Chorus: Kiko Bun]\nYou don\u2019t know, what I\u2019m looking for\nYou don\u2019t know oh, what I\u2019m looking for\nYou don\u2019t know, what I\u2019m looking for\nYou don\u2019t know oh, what I\u2019m looking for\n\n[Outro: Kiko Bun]\nMmm, you don\u2019t know what I\u2019m looking for\nNo no no no no, ooo\nYou don\u2019t know, what I\u2019m looking for\nNo, oh oh oh, mmm7Embed"

   "lyrics": "Sun of Jean Lyrics[Verse 1: Loyle Carner]\nAyy, we just supported Nas\nWhose world is this? Bruv, of course it's ours\nSaying I ain't been the same since I caught the scars\nThey don't fade, I ain't ashamed, watch us fall from Mars\n'Cause it's the fallen parts and all the dust settles\nAnd we all call on ours fast as we pluck petals\nUh, we let the love pour into our brain\nAnother day doing more to maintain\nSaying finally those tears in my mother's eyes\nTears from the other side\nTears of joy, her little boy's got his mother's pride\nYou don't know nothing 'bout the rain 'til you come inside\nAnd watch it trickle past the pane as the summer rise\n'Cause ain't no love inside my heart\nUh, except for my mother and my diehards\nI stay firm, little brother keeps my mind sharp\nIf I lost yours, come and find ours\n[Chorus]\nI've got pleasures\nBecoming pressures\nThey make me want to drift away\nThey make me want to drift away\n\n[Verse 2: Loyle Carner]\nI wasn't running from the beast, I was running from myself\nRunning out of street, she was worried 'bout my health\nWasn't worried it was beef, wasn't worried it was girls\nShe was worried it was me and my mother couldn't tell\nSomething bigger than the world\nAy, for me and Ryan\nAy, now he could see that I've been crying\nTell a little lie and say there's something in my eye\nAnd from the second he could see that I've been lying\nHe would think I wasn't trying\nTelling him, look, honestly, I'm dying\nTo be the bigger man, the one that you're relying\nOn, I keep it strong, so I tell another lie\n'Cause it's the only way to keep me from denying\nSo I tell him, brother, listen, listen, when the sun don't glisten\nAll the days turn grey and the love goes missing\nHate won't fade and the front row hissing\nYou're the only one who keeps my heart wishing\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI've got pleasures\nBecoming pressures\nThey make me want to drift away\nThey make me want to drift away\nI've got pleasures\nBecoming pressures\nThey make me want to drift away\nThey make me want to drift away\n\n[Bridge: Loyle Carner]\nCall me the son of Jean, my little submarine\nMe and my mother, there ain't nothing that can come between\nCall me the son of Jean, my little submarine\nMe and my mother, there ain't nothing that can come between\n'Cause I'm the son of Jean\n\n[Verse 3: Loyle Carner]\nUh, but she said that it ain't me without ADHD\n88 keys, I was turning eighteen\nShe would stay and say please with a face that say cheese\nAlways tryna make peace like a plate of baked beans\nThat was me and my bean\nThat was me and my Jean\nThat was me and my Jean\n[Verse 4: Jean Coyle-Larner]\nHe was a scribble of a boy, all hair and mischief\nA two-foot tale of trouble, the bee's knees\nA cartwheeling chatterbox of tricks, completely fearless\nI had to carry a first aid kit, my band-aid boy\nI had my heart in my mouth wherever we went\nHe'd do backflips into the pool when he was tiny\nAnd the lifeguards would get all stressed out\nHe was a proper Mowgli, he embraced everything\nTook things apart to see what made them tick\nSuch busy fingers\nHe would empty sugar packets onto the tables\nIn restaurants to draw pictures in\nHe used to draw on anything\nFantastical creatures with ferocious fangs\nAnd now he draws with words\nAnd I find lyrics on my till receipts and bills\nHe was never still and barely slept, so neither did I\nI could never understand how he could watch TV\nUpside down while kicking a ball\nHis eyes shone with wonder\nMusic flowed through him like a current\nHe'd upend a stool to use as a microphone\nSinging away for his grandparents\nHe turned the world upside down and we're richer for it\nHe was and is a complete joy\nThe world is his, that scribble of a boy2Embed"
