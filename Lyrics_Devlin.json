   "lyrics": "Fire in the Booth Lyrics[Beat 1]\nI think you forget that Jim\u2019s been a threat and a vet\nSo long so where's the respect?\nYou ain't repped with DJ Slimzee on set\nI ain't heard you on a tape or cassette\nCause weren't present when grime weren't pleasant\nA game full of shottas and goons and peasants\nRascal run away with the scene\nMan on par with the stickiest lemon\nThe mic in my hands like a stick to a felon\nLetting off rhymes my mouth is my weapon\nBlowing up south, Peckham to Streatham\nBlowing up west from Acton to Shepherds\nAnd my name spread north of course\nTottenham to Angel I rock the cradle\nAnd I been running round east from day\nDagenham to Barking, Hackney to Cable Street\nWith a lyrically shot speed\nEvery man from a manor where the blocks deep\nWhere your block's like an episode of Dawson's Creek\nRest in peace to the Esco\nLet's go, anyone who built this scene\nI'm taking it back to an old school theme\nI'm oceans deep and they flow too weak\nSide with me and fly like a frisbee\nGo against me and die like Da Vinci\nI open the pages and write in the history\nI'm right in the middle of my life it's a mystery\nI wound up on an Island with Tinchy\nA label Marley made famous\nSee a minor, that's why I'm major\nShut one eye then stare at my wallet\nYou still won't ever see half of my paper\nLife's a ride how far it will take ya\nDepends how far that you'll break ya\nBack to make ya stack bigger than a freight container\nMore cash more money in the bank\nTill I die and reside with the maker\nI'll shoot for the hoop like I was a Laker\nYou said white boys can't jump you're a hater\nI'll jump all over your boat race then shout later\nI'm the administrator for pain inside of a chamber\nFull of nightmares I don't fight fair\nIf I wanna find breh's I don\u2019t use no satellite navigator\nCause the word on the street is that you're in town with your bird on the weekend\nWhat's the odds that we just might meet then?\nWhen I run up on you like an east end weed den\n[Beat 2]\nYou show me the conditions, hear the terms of my recital\nMurmur and I'll murder you so bring the German rifles\nI'm rolling with the Kalashnikov I'm backing off my rivals\nCall me (censored) I\u2019ll kill you off like (censored)\nAnd naa I ain't acting I'm as practically a spiteful\nAs going back in time to give the atom bomb to Guy Fawkes\nNow I'm stuck and I\u2019m waiting for a time warp\nTo once again return you can\u2019t terminate a cyborg\nI'm made of metal, I could break you all like ply board\nBroke the ground level, now like Luke, I like to sky-walk\nI'm a dying rebel like Gaddafi not compliable\nI'll stab you with a paint brush, there's art in my survival\nI'm like a cyclops with the all seeing eyeball\nAnd all I see is weed to think it's time to build an ital\nBurn you to degrees that your skeleton is frightful\nAfter they discover you in my ash tray after nightfall\nI kept it real but all they seem to want is fake\nI should speak like a wanker and spit bars like Drake\nFishing hook aaahhh bait, I'll come to your estate\nAnd slap your mates who insisted that you was great\nAnd then I'll take your style and your charisma\nCombine em with tobacco and ignite em in a Rizla\nYou left me in my lane we all tried to play the game\nSo now you need to ascertain that I could flip you like your sister\nBut no homo just poisoning the promo\nCharlie ain't a sloth naa he's a yeti in a polo\nAnd Devlin I'm a dragon reigning fire on your postcode\nI hold gold so let me throw a blow and leave your nose broke\nLike Britannia it's black and white like a panda\nThe devils levels higher looking down from my veranda\nAnd so that you know what you hold is false hope\nAnd false goals don't account for much when the truths told\nSorry for the flames I induce this is murder\nBlame put the name on my crew this is murder\nJimmy I'm an Essex boy so you know it's murder\nGreater London in between the city and suburbia\nHold tight Klash and Terra Firma, it's murder\nD-E-V-L-I-N, yeah you know it's murder\nCharlie Sloth the DJ that you all hearda' it\u2019s murder\nD-E-V-L-I-N, murder\nYou might also like[Beat 3]\nIt's OT crew in the house again\nWe been endowed with the strength of a thousand men\nI live a long dream make a biro bleed\nTurn a ball point into a fountain pen\nWhen I spew red rivers I'm deading you\nGetting you coming for your revenue too\nYou ain't never dwelt in the places I've been\nI'm at home in the dark like Nosferatu\nOr king Tut locked up in his tomb\nFor too many suns and too many moons\nWhites and blacks who thrive to attack\nDagenham scums inside of the room\nSo there might quite be violence soon\nHear the sirens sound like Rascal and shoot\nThen boot to the closest district tube\nBig up Wiley he always knew\nThat I'd be a beast and a brute\nAnd pollute the peace in the booth\nLike pumping the sea fulla' crude oil\nWhen I get deeper I\u2019m rude\nSo the better I get you're all screwed\nAm I a veteran? Yes you'll get moved\nWeren't pulling your legs when I said I was a threat\nI\u2019m ill but will punch you out of ya shoes\nEnglish bomb with an Irish fuse\nAnd there\u2019s not long left till I detonate\nLeave guys in a two and eight in a right old state\nYou better have your giro saved\nI'm claiming anything I like ok\nCause I've found my groove and a ride\nThat keeps me amused this life is a game\nI'm old school like fruit of the loom\nBut I come brand new so the youth can relate\nAnd maybe try following the lead\nMy whole damn scene came outta the street\nWith young men letting off shots\nAnd kids getting killed by the rocks like Apollo 18\nI gotta swim through a sea fulla darkness\nIn a blackpool like Holloway's team\nForgive me if I take you for ransom\nNaa I'm like Manson I got a regime\nAnd I love bad vibes\nIn fact, I like it when everybody climbs on my back\nWhen the knifes at the ready and they try to attack\nBut my names not Caesar\u2013\nAnd who gave yous the right to react?\nTo put your wife on her back like Caroline Flack\nI ain't never been killed inside of the scene\nRed rum backwards analyse that\nStun gun a pussy I paralyze cats\nDon't sell drugs but I've got white raps\nI'm a messed up geezer I just might snap\nNot a wife beater but you might find me in Dags on a Friday\nBare knuckle fighting a slag and might have a fight with her dad\nThat's how it is cause my manors quite mad\nAnd the spotlight coulda' never changed this man\nGod damn, that's who I am3Embed"

blocked all the exits\nYes I'll be here forever\nAnd tread so far I'll leave here in leather\nSo dark, so cold\nWith a couple girls sitting on my lap\nI'm never gonna say I'm back\nI'm a little too in love with plaques\nI moved in to the hall of fame\nSo I wipe my feet on tracks\nI'mma kill it, I'm a killer\nSee me with one glove, it's a Thriller\nI already had a number one for my dinner\nMe and Devs go in there, inner\nAnd we're out of here, I doubt you're near\nI've already been a thousand 'ere\nBut if you live for the money, then you die for the money\nSo I ain't even trying to count it, I swear\nAnd if you don't think I'm fucked\nMiddle finger up\nFuck me, fuck you\nI'll make you feel small when I big you up\nUp, up and away, I can't see ya\nOn my own scale, I'm a Libra\nTold 'em leave me alone, I wanna leave, uh\nHad to give 'em some dough to get a pizza\nEvery day I have takeaway\nTomorrow won't be the same today\nI don't score when I'm at home\nI strike more when I play away\n[Verse 2: Devlin]\nShut down the asylum\nBefore I creep through the exit, find it\nJump any fence inside then drag a man\nOut of the car that he just was driving\nAnd then put the pedal to the floor\nI'm back and I'm ready for the war like a Viking\nI ain't gotta tell 'em any more, me and Wretch\nAlready killed this UK Grime thing\nAnd there's not a lot left that could swing with Shipman\nThe doctor of death\nLike Wretch 32 said it's off with his head\nGot cold feet then it's frost on your creps\nNever mind where you're walking, watch where you step\nMind what you're talking, I might dissect\nAny guy trying a bullshit vibe on a sec\nCan't fuck with me like my wife on the reds\nToo unorthodox to let it go\nSo I let 'em know that I'm pro, but my name ain't Stephen\nSoul seems to be involved\nI'm burying men six deep in a hole, no reason\nYou're getting buried alive, I'm tryna better my life\nWhile some men are cutting up suits\nWith scissors and severing ties\nI let 'em know that it's Devlin's time\nNo disputing I shift to the move\nThis game from the days of The Movement\nUsing the only utensil I knew to\nNow I need loot this, alike to my figures on YouTube\nRetreat or advance then, you choose\nAt the present I'm king like Presley\nTest me, then I'm running out full of anger\nAnd envy and stamping you out in my blue shoes\nYou might also like[Verse 3: Wretch 32]\nRide a beat like a Traktor, ey\nBut I ain't getting on a train, 'ey\nEverybody wants to act up, yeah\n'Til you put 'em in the frame\nAnd I ain't got time for shit, patience's thinner than my toilet roll\nI'm a fixed up brother from a broken home\nI remember I used to watch Home Alone\nNow I'm home alone in my own home\nThis millennium, got a loada dome\nRome then roam\nCame home smelling like hot Cologne\nHad a success overdose, oh\nYou see my roll-on flow\nAnd I'm so sure that I can't be old\nYet all my heels I carry on toe to toe\nWhen we take this game now, so cologne\n\n[Verse 4: Devlin]\nYou couldn't play my post\nI'm an old soul like an ancient ghost\nThat created his name in the game and he\nTook shit to another level on the whole\nI can't really explain my brain\nBut if you peeked inside of my skull\nYou'd see shit so deep in my rear right lobe\nThat you'd know why I feel this cold\nAnd I feel like the caped crusader\nHere on the brink of a dangerous caper\nI'm always collected and calm in battle\nCan't be rattled, go sample a shaker\nOT, I'm an out taker\nI'm taking out any men that are minor\nAnd think that they're major, there's a devil and a\nWretch that just broke out of the chamber\n[Verse 5: Wretch 32]\nYes, now I'm going for the hat-trick\nOne singer, one model, one actress\nBut I might disappear if you're acting\nOr singing me a new tune on a mad pitch\nBack to my rap shit\nI'mma go hard this year\nCan't be looking at the past this year\nThat won't help me get past this year\nIn an extra zone next to tracks\nMultiple hits but with extra swag\nI've divided my time\nRoyalties won't forget to add\nAnd I ain't adding nobody on my BB\nIPhone when I want you to see me\nI played, YouTube\nSee me on Wretch 32 TV\n\n[Verse 6: Devlin]\nI'm getting flashbacks from the past\nHead full of hate and a mouth full of bars\nMe and Wretch just stretched this game to a next span\nTaking the extra yard\nWe're going extra hard, no I can not be barred\nSay what you want, but you couldn't keep Devs out\nAnyways, I've already broke through the fence now\nAnd I'm quite relentless when I vex out\nEverybody wants to the the next out\nBut they get stripped like a bitch when her dress down\nThink you're a face round 'ere?\nGet left lying face down in a next town\nPull strings like Robbie Lamond\nOn the beat and I'm dropping the bomb\nI'll make you all feel sick like Sue Bo dropping her thong\nThis ain't Sumo but I'm too big and too strong1Embed"

I'm not really on that\nBut I can only can take so much before I'm forced to engage in the sequence of combat\nBut it's not like back in the day where you could swing it out with a man and it's over\nCause nowadays man will come back round the bits with a samurai sword or a revolver\nYeah everybody wants to get physical\nBusiness on the road is criminal\nAnd I tried it and I didn't mind it\nBut lately, most of my business is lyrical\nAnd everyday there's another beef\nThere's another little argument\nAnother little cheef\nLoosing countless hours of sleep\nAnd I'm stick, don't know how to receive\nAnd I'm trying to stay strong but I'm still young\nIn the land where mums get left without sons\nDon't know what to say I'm speechless for words that everyday shit of the slums\nEveryday\nHol' tight my boys\nGot love for you all\nIt's real\n\nYeah I smoke weed to escape\nCause every other day that I live in this world\nI tempt fate in this place full of hate\nBut what keeps me going is my boys like Bramy and Paige, the strongest people\nOur love ones never die they're the white dogs of the church steeple\nThis world is evil, and my boys can't get a job so they do shit that's illegal\nNo one plays fair, and no one gives a fuck everybody just wants to get paid here\nNo one plays here, and getting out of this shit is the vision that I stay clear\nBecause I'm dreaming and drifting the weight off my shoulder\nI'm lifting rejected by God at my christening\nNow it's time to speak out, because I feel that I've done enough listening\nAnd when we pass on to another land, we all leave footprints in the sand\nBut when your in your coffin and you bodies rotten\nYou don't really want your personality forgotten (Never that)\nI wanna' be cemented in time\nMe and my boys everyday in the grind\nEveryday another enemy I seem to find\nBut nobody is ahead of me in the space of time\nAnd you know what? I'm tired of my life\nTired of the bullshit, tired of the nights\nTired of these girls keep ringing me at night\nTelling them I'm at the ends, all the times I gotta lie\nAnd I'm fed up of my boys mum dying\nNothing worse than to see your boys crying\nI don't love or survive but I'm trying\nAnd to say that I'm not scared would be lyingYou might also likeEmbed"

I ain't nobody's savior\nWhen I'm chained to this glacier I'm a slave to the frost\nLike I made it with Sadie, and got knee deep in her slot, oh gosh\nYou might also like[Hook]\nAsk Terms, ask Shots\nAsk Ratch, ask Rawz ask Dogz\nI think that I've lost the plot\nCame back for the, back for the lot\nAnd it's fact that my faction is hot\nFrom the booth right back to the block\n(Right back to the block)\n(Right back to the block)\n\n[Verse 3]\nThis ain't a drill, no screw don\nWho the fuckin' hell are you, son?\nFind an exit and use one\nUnder credited for anythin' the crew done\nStill relative, a relative to you son\nWe're all brothers in this settlement, it's too glum\nSoon come, rise of a true sun\nToo blunt, I can be a true cunt\nToo drunk, chattin' to a new slut\nToo fucked, to ever give two fucks\nUnless I had sisters lubed up, who's up?\nYou wanna make a move huh?\nI'm killin' fish with this big harpoon gun\nMove up or get moved up by Devs\nAs far as young men go, I'm a rude one\nThere's six million ways you can die\nGive me time, I'm still tryna choose one, oh gosh\n[Hook]\nAsk Terms, ask Shots\nAsk Ratch, ask Rawz ask Dogz\nI think that I've lost the plot\nCame back for the, back for the lot\nAnd it's fact that my faction is hot\nFrom the booth right back to the block\n(Right back to the block)\n(Right back to the block)Embed"

Not quite\nFreeze me till my race turns out bright\nGuess so that officially means that I could sleep for a million weeks and then rise\nWhen I see F-I-T I'm that guy\nThey're going on B-A-D then get shy\nWho is it? D-E-V the mad guy\nKitty man, love titty and fat thighs\nYou can smile again this world is mine again\nNo time to play the timing's great\nI waited for brighter days to light the game and now they can't fight the flame\nI hear a lot of wannabe yanks from U.K\nTrap 'em in a bando 'til they lose weight\nForce him to smoke what he sell everyday\nTo people's children been led astray\nWe pray upon the weak in this world for the need to excel\nSo bun bein' weak I'm a beast you can tell\nI'm telling men I wanna [?] a girl\nDo a queef then smell when I read to myself in a region I dwell\nDream to myself in the freedom I sell [?]\nNever let a man lead you and tell\nGreat lies to achieve what he needs for himself\nThe future's in the grip of your palm\nAnd you wouldn't wanna rip it apart\nOnly mad men live in the past, it's 2008\nAin't that I'm scared to ask\nI maintain the charade for a state of calm\nDedicate time to creative art\nLike Kurt Cobain when he played guitar\nI'll sing [psyching away] while I lay in the bath\nAnd just drift\nMy thoughts are nomadic, I\u2019m real uninhibited\nI flow like magic\nBetween the heavenly dream and this challenge And this zone invisible that men can't savage\nSabotage or blast and attack it\nOut of your reach Armstrong couldn't grab it\nThird eye's open like the doors on the carriage\nWhen the highway men ask what's yours let 'em have it\n[Verse 2]\nCheck check check\n1,2\nBig up to Rookie Beats on the net man, big beats\nListen\nYeah, it's the\n\nOh I'm a screw-up\nI think it's time I grew up\n'Cause now I look so old that I could pass for 82 up\nAnd I ain't even 30 yet, oh what a dirty sket\nLife turned out to be, hope don't desert me yet\nWhy don't you come for me until my maker comes for me\n'Cause being the one to beat is taxing me, H.M.R.C\nThey're all hunting me\nI'm sitting here uncomfortably, sipping on my cup of tea\nThinking \"who, fucking me?\"\nThe cheek of it, I don't even know these cats\nRoll up on your cul-de-sac, smack you with a golden plaque\nI'll turn the show to ash till I can see that Charlie's sweatin'\nIt's like I'm cooking crack on camera in some grimey setting\nYeah you know it's that, guy that makes almighty efforts\nI'll serve a pint inside a shot glass, defying measures\nPlay me back, like podcasts and find treasures\nHoly Grime was just some bread for all you blind beggars\nI highly reckon that tiny seconds are worth their weight in gold\nAnd once they've gone you won't get 'em just like the Phoenix feathers\nCount your blessings, 'fore they count you out\nLike a boxer that got dropped just like a fart inside your mouth\nYou arse lickers, half spitters\nThinkin' that you're hard hitters, biggest here period\nThat's why they're wearing large knickers\nLove to Uncle, love to Char, love to Vic\nLove to Young Spray, E.G.A we made it through this shit\nLike Andy Dufresne, crawling through these sewer pipes\nTryna find the bluer sky, Devlin is do or die\nBut I'm so lazy I might choose death\nOnly joking, who's next?\nI can see the future in my sight\nThe booth is now alight\nIt's like I can't believe they're legally\nCharlie Sloth invited me to try ignite the BBC\nThere ain't to fighting me, no blighting me, no beating me\nI think these guys fancy me, that's why they always speak of me\nI set this fire in a booth part, 2\nI thought I'd nice you with a new spark\nGot everybody like \"that white man is too dark\"\nYou're bloody right, and this year's a new start\nI said, I set this fire in a booth part, 2\nI thought I'd nice you with a new spark\nGot everybody like \"that pale face is too dark\"\nYou're fucking right, and this year's a new start\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nWe're gonna go again\nCheck\nBig up PEZ OTB on this one\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nDevlin, Charlie Sloth\nListen\n\nIt's your best MCs worst nightmare\nThe devilish white breh that don't quite care and I'm right here\nYo Slothy, when I bring the horror like Shotty\nThey're insignificant, it's quite clear\nNobody, can make me look sloppy\nThis shit is my whole damn life not a hobby\nI was in the bits tryna grind for a bobby\nNow I'm on the mic everybody's gettin' bodied\nArses ask me if I still feel relevant\nRelevant? What's relevant? Shottin' heroin?\nMurder? Lies? Cash over anything?\nKids don't be silly with your life, be intelligent\nAnd acquire what you need and more\nTelevision is a weapon and they're winning a war\nIt's all Towie and Geordie Shore, it's not cool to be thick\nNor to be a Northern whore\nAdore and implore me I'm sure that I couldn't give a shit anymore\nYou ain't even wanna spit on the floor\nWhen I'm finished, yeah bringing the raw\nOr shop round, there ain't none bigger in store\nI've been around, from the A.M. check my M.O\nBuilding blocks like Ed Sheeran with Lego\nTraipse in the field no life in the meadows\nNighttime runnin' with the grimiest fellows\nI hear echos\nI feel as though I've lived 20 lives already, I ain't sure\nGoes so quick, I was told don't blink so I didn't for a minute and my eyes got sore\nBellies of yellow I feel like like mental\nChat wet like Marti Pellow and what for\nThat's why I'm on a level and the sun won't settle on my soul when I slip and I slide from the tour\nProblem child with a red bow-tie\nGivin' 'em what for, the pit with locked jaw, I clamp when I bite\nGivin' 'em lots more than gas when I write\nLyrically top draw, dismantling mics\nSound mechanic, dem man just sound mechanic\nI'll bring a wave that'll drown the planet\nWhen I'm playing with the flame and grab it\nGet burned in a state of panic\nI was made erratic, Private Pyle, full metal jacket\nLoopy and wild\nCharlie, stay in the booth for too long and you'll be grey like me\nIt's the radiation of a nuclear star\nYou'll see the file\nAnything I wanna do, choose to \u2018n\u2019 smile\nCasting a spell, it's the voodoo child\nSalem, I'm in a witch hunt no trial\nThe only justice I know is poetical\nThey don't wanna hype me? Go let em all, I'll get em all\nI'm highly incredible, I'm making a circle spherical\nMore substance when I tell 'em all\nYou wanna ride with Devs, you'll need a miracle\nBun your life for bling, it's so unethical\nYou know what? F 'em all\nI'll start my own terraform where some people were never bornEmbed"

Me\nIt felt like amazing grace\nI was blind, now I see\n\n[Verse 2]\nWanna know where I've been? Me too\nIt's a blur of booze and birds\nWake up with a hand all bruised and I ain't got a clue what occurred\nI've been the prick too long, going on like I don't care about the career I tailored\nFrom the stone and bricks in Satan's lair\nBut life will take you there when you get robbed of a relative\nAnd when I drive by your old flat, I blow a kiss and reminisce\nI can't write inside this pad, I'm more pissed than I've ever been\nSo I try to escape this curse, tryna run from the devil in\n\n[Bridge 2]\nCome on brother\nYou made this man\nI think the game needs this bruv\nThis is all you fucking know\nNeed to get up man\nYou might also like[Hook]\nThe devil inside of me\nThe side you just don't see\nI've been fighting, who? Me\nIt felt like amazing grace\nI was blind, now I see\n\n[Verse 3]\nI wake up on the sofa with a sore head in my friends house\nNo cash in my wallet, I know that I'm back in the ends now\nFactories, flats and vomit\nEvery house looks run down\nScrew-face and I'm on it, I ain't hard like onyx\nBut lost it, where's the anti-psychotics?\nI'm falling apart but the streets ask\nWhen's the album dropping?\nWhen this writers' block subsides and I feel like writing again about topics\nUntil then I just crawl inside my shell and it feels so horrid\n\n[Hook]\nThe devil inside of me\nThe side you just don't see\nI said I've been fighting, who? Me\nIt felt like amazing grace\nI was blind, now I see, now I seeEmbed"
