your whip  - you dash in it\nSaid you were packing a mac in the back of it\nKizzy, I'm busy, I'm really a brilliant guy\nIt's gritty and shitty but really the city is mine\nIf you diss me, pity the silly billy to try\nFrom Bricky to Piccadilly to Mississippi I'm live\nGetting rid of you Milli Vanilli's, gimme the vibe\nGet jiggy like Willy spitting the wittiest rhymes\nUncivilised, ignorant, diligent type\nAnd I victimise an idiot a million times\nHey hey, we ray rays will spray flames\nTake snakes off the road like AA\nSo waste brays, vacate, and make space\nYou bait fakes ain't straight, you stay fake\nWe chase papes, you chase dames like 'Babes wait!'\nOn a lay-lay you date rape to save face\nIn the same place, we maintain and ain't changed\nWe make tapes that rake papes like Kay-Slay\nDon't dismiss or diss this we live this from Lisbon to Ipswich\nFor instance the dick's got your sister addicted\nOh look, big tits came for a quick fix\nYou're limper than Bizkit you nitwits\nA monster, a beast, when I stomp on the beat\nIf the nonsense you speak is not gonna cease\nUnconscious but leave unconscious MCs\nDon't respond to the beef if your nonces or neeks\nGet ill up on the rhythm when I kill 'em on a lyrical\nFinish up my dinner then I drill 'em with a syllable\nDon't really care what you did and what you didn't do\nLittle fools are minuscule, spitting isn't difficult\nYou find your mind cause I'm out of mine\nFuck a pound sign, came for the crown of grime\nI told you once, I told you a thousand times\nI'm a fountain of acid, you're alkaline\nYou alcoholics are out of line\nGot a mountain to climb if your mouth is lying\nBow to his highness, I'm bound to shine\nLet me coach you on vocals and how to rhyme\nThink I'm vexed with your indirects\nIf I spit rhymes next I will slit five necks\nI'm a big time threat, to your pissed sly vets\nThis guy lives life inside stress\nI'm the best in the game, not impressed with the fame\nI'm testing my aim if I send for your name\nThe successful are lame, they kept it the same\nBut whatever the weather, it's destined to change\nCouldn't give a fuck for your creps and your chains\nYou slobber on the mic like a sket giving brain\nI'm mental, deranged, crush temples and frames\nMy pencil will end you like petrol and flames\nBurn like syphilis, you nerds are privileged\nWhen I die you can say that you heard the sickest spit\nMy verse it limitless, the earth is spinning quick\nPure words of wickedness that I merk the rhythm with\nHeard you were good, It's a shame that you're not\nDon't care about your chain or the fame that you got\nKeep my name on your brain cause I came for your spot\nWhat you're making is pot, they say it's a lot\nYou're whack bro with your cat flow\nBut you're whack though put your cap low\nPrat go back home\nThis monster is stronger than Castro's backbone\nI attack those little fat bowcats so...\nDon't ever get arrogant\nDon't start panicking, phone your management\nMumbling, man are in the manor getting mad again\nDon't care about your swagger, mandem, or medallion\nWhat's the matter then, maggot where's your magnum?\nWhen there's beef, mandem are missing like Madeleine\nI've been badder than you and your bag of men\nWhat's happening when I kill 'em with a pad and pen\nAin't got the bars in your pad to match me\nMe I'm so fast, you should catch a taxi\nHave you got the picture like Paparazzi?\nYou lack the facts that go back-to-back, b\nWhen I watch you rap it's like crazy comedy\nI got a 'don't rate fake G' policy\nFuck your awards, I don't rate these nominees\nJust little fickle Jay-Z wannabes\nYou hobos are old and It's oh so true\nNo promo, logo, or photo-shoot\nFuck your postcode, MOBO and polo suit\nMy opponents are hoping I won't go through\nI'm certainly burning these burglars verbally\nMerking these merkers 'til mercenaries murder me\nBurst in and turnin' your Burberry burgundy\nGuernsey to Germany, Jersey to Bermondsey\nTrue rhymes, ain't got a pen? You can use mine\nAin't stayin' underground like a tube line\nI'm'ma come through and shine, in due time\nWhich one of you pricks said I can't do grime?\nGenre crosser, nonsense stopper\nContinent stomper, the conscious monster\nThe freedom fighter, deepest writer\nBeat up cyphers, the peoples' rhymer\nI'm bond to get iller, the sound effects killer\nThe Malcolm X spitter, the alphabet killer\nNot a player hater, lady dater\nMaybe later a baby maker\nI get slept on like old pyjamas\nWill I blow up like boats in the harbour?\nYou spit fire, I'm molten lava\nFlow so cold I scold your father\nSold your soul for gold and Prada\nWho do you know who's flow goes harder?\nIt's over partner, you know the answer\nDrop bombs on the rhythm, no Obama\nBaseline murderer, fake guy hurter, race line hurdler\nFace flying all over the place like furniture\nI'm back so hard might break my vertebrae\nBeat breaker, heat taker, sheet of paper cremator, since a teenager\nDJs can't be BKRs cause if they do they'll get PAR'd\nI'm back so let me see, the facts are very deep\nYou prats will never see, I rap to any beat\nPack the pen and P, practice every week\nAttack the melody, and smash my enemies\nNot a sent bro, but you're getting dough\nWith a bent flow jacking off Jay-Z like a little klepto\nAnd the tempo went slow\nDone a lot in my lifetime, I was retro\nEverybody bow to the king cause he's back\nWhether or not radio was in his track\nForget Nas and his dad cause I'm bridging the gap\nYou think it's just rap, but it's bigger than that\nIf it's tit for tat, I got the gift of the gat\nWhat you spit is just shit, blood, stick to the facts\nYou itch like a cat that's addicted to crack\nI'm sick of you Prats, cause you shitheads is whack\nI'm a G, any beat, I will damage\nVery deep, whether it be grime or garage\nEnemies better flee, I won't have it\nYou'll never be ahead of me you blind old maggot\nIf you really really live crime, don't chat it\nIf you really really got a 9, go grab it\nThen, if you're live, don't hide, don't panic\nJust ride like a psycho that might go manic\nDon't settle with the rest, cause I'm better than the best\nNot just clever, yes I'm intelligent and best you\nBetter invest in some weapons and a vest\nYou veterans are vexed, irrelevant and stressed\nKeep telling us your rep, but you never get respect\nYou fed up cause seven of your regiments are messed\nYou could get a bit of press for that ice on your neck\nIt's not credit, it's a debt\nI'm here for the beat, just save all the nonsense\nMurk it whether a rave or a concert\nWhen I'm on stage, make way for the monster\nKey to the Game: I came, toured, and conquered\nSpit on your bars, I spray more for longer\nYou spit boring, chainsaw's are stronger\nYou're a boxer, wait, you're a mobster\nAin't got time for fake fraud impostors\nI'm a champ, deep MC and it's blatant\nBut tramps wanna sleep on me like a pavement\nWhen I speak, I leave them chiefs in amazement\nMeanest genius, I'm free like a mason\nBut I don't sleep with police at the station\nI'm writing my rhymes, you're completing your statement\nRunning from the swine while you're eating your bacon\nDon't rip beats, I beat them and break 'em\nMost MCs don't believe them or rate 'em\nIt's no secret, these neeks are just hating\nKeep on saying that my team isn't flaming\nLight fire like them trees that you're blazing\nDouble P, trouble we, there'll be an invasion\nTest us? Get left deep in the basement\nDon't care whether you're from Ealing or Leyton\nMiddle Eastern or Asian...\nLittle man never did exams\nGot a particular bigger plan flippin' grams\n'Til a bigger man in his gang gave him a stick to bang\nOr maybe just hold cause no one thought he would kill a man\n'Till he caught a silly billy villain, chillin' in a jam\nSippin' champs, spliff in his hand, trigger didn't jam...\nBang bang biddy bang biddy biddy bang\nNow he's in the can thinkin' \"Damn, what a pity fam.\"\nRappers are yapping and flapping their lips\n'Bout how they're packing and clapping their sticks\nHas to be big, the impact it has on the kids\nTell me where the factory is\nWhen the government kill, they're just stacking their chips\nYou wonder why the yout-dem are strapped and they're pissed\nIf not a nine, it's a knife getting jabbed in your ribs\nPeople die for the petrol, the gas in our whips\nIn London, you can get shanked in the heart\nStill the government put more tanks in Iraq\nIgnorant little spitters are talking greasy\nCause they bitten bitties that they saw on TV\nIf all you rap about is the hoes and the dough\nIt's already too late, you sold 'em your soul\nYou jokers act like you know but you don't\nCause there's little kids dying all over the globe\nMany say they know what revolution could be\nBut many don't know what revolution would mean\nIt would mean blood, it would mean pain\nBut it could be us to bring that change\nLittle hypocrites are spittin' typical nonsense\nAm I blackballed because of political content?\nLaugh at my people while you criminals bomb them\nMilitant on the rhythm, I'm killing you on the song then\nHistory you won't read in a textbook\nKunta Kinte, I bleed from my left foot\nNever see me on the TV with Jedward\nTell the BBC they need me on WestwoodYou might also like22Embed"

According to the dictionary I hold in my hand, terror is violent or destructive acts, such as bombing committed by groups in order to intimidate a population, or government into granting their demands. So what's a terrorist?\n\n[Hook]\nThey're calling me a terrorist\nLike they don't know who the terror is\nWhen they put it on me, I tell them this\nI'm all about peace and love\nThey calling me a terrorist\nLike they don't know who the terror is\nInsulting my intelligence\nOh how these people judge\n[Verse 1]\nIt seems like the Rag-heads and Pakis are worrying your dad\nBut your dad's favourite food is curry and kebab\nIt's funny, but it's sad\nHow they make your mummy hurry with her bags\nRather read the Sun than study all the facts\nTell me, what's the bigger threat to human society\nBAE Systems or home-made IED's?\nRemote-controlled drones killing off human lives\nOr man with home-made bomb committing suicide?\nI know you were terrified when you saw the towers fall\nIt's all terror, but some forms are more powerful\nIt seems nuts, how could there be such agony?\nWhen more Israelis die from peanut allergies\nIt's like the definition didn't ever exist\nI guess it's all just dependent who your nemesis is\nIrrelevant how eloquent the rhetoric peddler is\nThey're telling fibs, now tell us who the real terrorist is\n\n[Hook]\nThey're calling me a terrorist\nLike they don't know who the terror is\nWhen they put it on me, I tell them this\nI'm all about peace and love\nThey calling me a terrorist\nLike they don't know who the terror is\nInsulting my intelligence\nOh how these people judge\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nLumumba was democracy, Mosadegh was democracy\nAllende was democracy; hypocrisy, it bothers me\nCall you terrorists if you don't wanna be a colony\nRefuse to bow down to a policy of robberies\nIs terrorism my lyrics?\nWhen more Vietnam vets kill themselves\nAfter the war than die in it\nThis is very basic; one nation in the world\nHas over a thousand military bases\nThey say it's religion, when clearly it isn't\nIt's not just Muslims that oppose your imperialism\nIs Hugo Chavez a Muslim? Nah\u2026 I didn't think so\nIs Castro a Muslim? Nah\u2026 I didn't think so\nIt's like the definition didn't ever exist\nI guess it's all just dependent who your nemesis is\nIrrelevant how eloquent the rhetoric peddler is\nThey're telling fibs, now tell us who the terrorist is\n\n[Hook]\nThey're calling me a terrorist\nLike they don't know who the terror is\nWhen they put it on me, I tell them this\nI'm all about peace and love\nThey calling me a terrorist\nLike they don't know who the terror is\nInsulting my intelligence\nOh how these people judge\n[Bridge]\nYou think that I don\u2019t know\nBut I know, I know, I know\nYou think that we don\u2019t know, but we know\nYou think that I don\u2019t know\nBut I know, I know, I know\nYou think that we don\u2019t know, but we do\n\n[Outro]\nWas Building 7 terrorism?\nWas nano-thermite terrorism?\nDiego Garcia was terrorism\nI am conscious the Contras was terrorism\nPhosphorous that burns hands \u2013 that is terrorism\nIrgun and Stern Gang, that was terrorism\nWhat they did in Hiroshima was terrorism\nWhat they did in Fallujah was terrorism\nMandela ANC \u2013 they called terrorism\nGerry Adams IRA \u2013 they called terrorism\nErik Prince Blackwater \u2013 it was terrorism\nOklahoma, McVeigh \u2013 that was terrorism\nEveryday USA \u2013 that is terrorism\nEveryday UK \u2013 that is terrorism, every day\n\nEvery day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day\n\nYou think that we don't know know but we do...16Embed"

   "lyrics": "Bars For My Brother Lyrics[Verse 1: Lowkey]\nI hope you're somewhere listening to this\nI wish I knew why you did what you did\nCause I still haven't really come to terms with the truth\nThere must have been something you were determined to do\nThe lessons you taught me, I can't forget\nBut there's so many unanswered questions\nNow everything seems meaningless\nYou lived fast and died young\nBut my brother you were a genius\nHow could you ever believe that you'll survive\nI don't care what they say, that shit is suicide\nI won't lie, there was much distance between you and I\nI should've told you not to do it, don't be stupid\nYou've got looks, got brains and your future's bright\nNow you're gone I feel like I'm gon' lose my mind\nI never thought you'd get yourself organised\nI wish we saw the signs, the shock left us all traumatised\nThese are awful times, and I need more than rhymes\nCause this was more than a tragedy\nYou can't just cheat the forces of gravity\nYou left me here to hold a brave face supporting the family\n[Verse 2: Lowkey]\nIn a way you were dying to live\nIt's fucked up man, I'm crying while I'm writing this shit\nWater from my eyes is stopping me from lighting my spliff\nWhy didn't you realise that your life is a gift\nMum and Dad don't understand why they've outlived their son\nEvery single CD, Mix Tape and Album to come\nIs dedicated to no other than my blood brother\nBut I hate you, for the way you made my Mum suffer\nWords can't explain, how a certain part of my heart hurts with the harshest pain\nLast time we spoke, we said we weren't brothers and we aren't the same\nI told myself you were too far past insane\nHow could we not take your death badly\nI just asked mum and she said your name meant happy\n\n[Verse 3: Lowkey\nBut my soul is too cold to laugh\nMy heart bleeds when I'm looking at your old school photograph\nI wish that I could touch your beautiful flesh\nI'm writing but we ain't even had the funeral yet\nNow death is something, that I'm staying ever ready for\nYou had plenty more to give, you weren't even 24\nI don't understand why you had to die\nIn a lot of rappers rhymes, death is glamorised\nNot me, I'll always stay remembering you\nI should've known this was something you'd eventually do\nWhen you got shift, we should've known it was bad\nThe next day I was sitting here consoling my Dad\nIt's like a nightmare, it still doesn't seem real\nYou might also like[Verse 4: Lowkey]\nBut this is my life, not some fucking deep film\nIt's the strange feeling I felt in the late night\nWitnesses said that you fell from a great height\nCan't be my brother man, tell me it ain't right\nRight now I'd rather blaze, we could face life\nShit what a waste, what a shame\nI just gotta make sure your life wasn't lost in vain\nThis is my brother, not just a departed friend\nSo hard for my marj and them to start again\nFrom now on our lives will never be the same\nWe holding on too tight for the memories to fade\n24 years was hardly a life\nOn the day you passed, it's like a part of me died\nI've been scarred many times but this pain is so much worse\nAnd it's so much harder to describe\nYou will still be missed\nI'm sorry we didn't support you, we thought we did\nI wish I broke your leg so you couldn't jump\nNow all I can do...is rep your fuckin name like I should've done\nCause it's only right\nI'm still not sleeping, but now I'm seeing your ghost at night\nWe all wish we could've stopped you\nI know I can't go back in time now, but I want to\nIt's like a tightened knot that I can't undo\nWhy did I have to lose you to realise I loved you\nBe careful what you wish for, in case it comes true\nRight now I'm confused, feeling so subdued\nWhen they arrested you, they wanted to sanction you\nThe only thing we did wrong was going and getting you\nNext morning you was up, not doing what you was meant to do\nThat wasn't the life that you were meant to have\nThat wasn't the way that it was meant to be\nYou were sick, not physically but mentally\nI still ain't got a fraction of this shit off of my chest\nAll that goes through my mind is the constant regret\nWhy why why did you die for no reason\nAll of a sudden the weathers cold its so freezin\nHave you ever head the saying, when it rains it pours\nDon't ever try to tell me my pain is the same as yours\nCause it's not, and everything isn't what it seems\nI'm pinching myself but I know that this is not a dream\nWhy did you have to do that, this isn't fair\nListen my brother, never think that I didn't care\nThere's no words to describe the way that this feels\nNow I can clearly separate the fake from the real\nWhy did everyone else have to be bro\nI still can't quiet believe that you're actually gone\nJust 5 days, 5 days and it feels like the same day\nWeed ain't helpin but I need it just to maintain\nCause the bleak reality is terrible\nAnd last night mom was practically hysterical\nPeople I thought would care, couldn't care less\nI need a lot of support cause I'm feeling bare stressed\nAnd everyone else seems immature\nI'm being tested, thinking what is there left that I'm living for\nI need to clear my thoughts, stop thinking and try n breathe\nJust a week ago I was so innocent and naive\nNow my insides are burning like hells flames\nI've realised up until now I've never felt pain\nIt's so evident that everything I cared about before was so irrelevant\nThere's certain people that call when they see that this shit is hurtin\nBut I see them for what they are now cause I'm a different person\n\nR.I.P\nIn fact fuck R.I.P\nI want you to live through me\nLive through me...\nLive through me...\nLive...through...me...5Embed"

the MVP, VIP to the E.N.D\nEG my CD, is way to D.E.E.P\nThat goes for your TV screen, DVD or BBC\nITN or ITV, C.O.P say ID please\nS.T.O.P like IC3, wanna see me hooked to an I.V G\nIn the ICU but Im N.O.T, they went O.T with the M.O.B\nCan't see me through the F.O.G\nDon't cuss mothers of S.O.B's\nThese MCs are OAPs\nWanna hype up I'm like OK, G\nYou think you're B.A.D\nGet a P.E.N and a P.A.D\nIf the CIA and the FBI, the MI6 and the MI5\nGet on the A3 then I drive, turn up the A/C, FYI\nMJ like P.Y.T, LOL I never T.Y.P\nI E.A.T on E.I.D, twist the C.I.D like Levi Jeans\nD.I.E like BNP; EDL just BFGs\nYouths don't want no GCSE's they want C.O.D on the PS3\nIm like DP or PE, or KRS from BDP\nDownload this on your MP3\nSend it to your MP & MTV\nYou're not on this thing like A.D.D\nYour CD I rate PG\nLike KKK's with AK's\nMy A.K.A is AA\nTake you off the road ASAP\nDDT these JLS MC's\nWhat you just saw basically\nIs how to murder the ABC\nCos Im back in the booth\nRappers wanna chat about the strap they got stashed in the back of their boot\nBut I chat to the youths\nAbstract or backpack my attributes and stack to the roof\nI capture the truth\nPour it on tracks my view and I'll sell it out the back of the boot\nIm positive you're negative, you're whack and confused\nIm back and the fact is your dad's in the room\nAin't a track that you rappers can battle with\nEvery track that I spat is immaculate\nAny track that I smash Im attacking it\nHeard you rap fam, your tracks are inadequate\nYour CD was kak, it was crap, Im dashing it\nYou follow fashion with rap, Im passionate\nBlood start splashing you, whip you're dashing it\nSaid you were packing a mac in the back of it\nKizzy, Im busy, Im really a brilliant guy\nIt's gritty and shitty but really the city is mine\nIf you diss me, pity the silly billy to try\nFrom bricky to Piccadilly to Mississippi Im live\nGetting rid of you milli vanilli's gimme the vibe\nGet jiggy like willy spitting the wittiest rhymes\nUncivilised, ignorant diligent type\nAnd I victimise an idiot a million times\nHey hey, we ray rays and sway flames\nTake snakes of the road like AA\nSo waste brays, vacate and make space\nYou bate fakes ain't straight, you stay fake\nWe chase papes, you chased dames like \"Babes, wait\"\nOn a lay-lay you date rape to save face\nIn the same place, we maintain and ain't changed\nWe make tapes that rake papes like Kay Slay\nDon't diss this or miss this we live this from Lisbon to Ipswich\nFor instance the dick's got your sister addicted\nOh look, big tits came for a quick fix\nYou're limper than Bizkit you nitwits\nA monster, a beast, when I stomp on the beat\nIf the nonsense you speak is not gonna cease\nI\u2019m conscious but leave unconscious emcees\nDon't respond to the beef if you're nonces or neeks\nGet ill up on the rhythm when I kill 'em on a lyrical\nFinish up my dinner then drill 'em with a syllable\nDon't really care what you did and what you didn't do\nLittle fools are miniscule, spitting isn't difficult\nYou find your mind cos Im out of mine\nFuck a pound sign came for the crown of grime\nI told you once, I told you a thousand times\nIm a fountain of acid, you're alkaline\nYou alcoholics are out of Time\nGot a mountain to climb if your mouth is lying\nBow to his higness, Im bound to shine\nLet me coach you on vocals and how to rhyme\nThink Im vexed with your indirects\nIf I spit rhymes next I slit five necks\nI\u2019m a big time threat to you pissed, sly vets\nThis guy lives life inside stress\nIm the best in the game, not impressed with the fame\nIm testing my aim if I send for your name\nThe successful are lame, they kept it the same\nBut whatever the weather It's destined to change\nCouldn't give a fuck for your creps and your chains\nYou slobber on the mic like a sket giving brain\nIm mental, deranged, crush temples and frames\nMy pencil will end you like prepetual flames\nBurn like syphilis, you nerds are privileged\nWhen I die you can say that you heard the sickest spit\nMy verse it limitless, the earth is spinning quick\nPure words of wickedness that I merk the rhythm with\nHeard you were good, It's a shame that you're not\nDon't care about your chain or the fame that you got\nKeep my name on your brain cos I came for your spot\nWhat you\u2019re making is pop, they say it's a lot\nYou're whack bro with your kak flow\nBut you're whack though put ya cap low\nPrat go back home\nThis monster is stronger than Castro's backbone\nI attack those little Fapo Caso's\nDon't ever get arrogant\nDon't start panicking, phone your management\nMumbling, mannering that man are getting mad again\nDon't care about your swagger, mandem or medallion\nWhat's the matter then, magger where's your magnum\nWhen theres beef mandem are missing like Madeleine\nI've been badder than you and your bag of men\nWhat's happening when I kill 'em with a pad and pen\nAin't got the bars in your pad to match me\nMe im so fast, you should catch a taxi\nHave you got a picture like Paparazzi?\nYou lack the facts that go back to back b\nWhat I watch you rappers It's like crazy comedy\nI got a 'dont rate this fake G' policy\nFuck your awards, I don\u2019t rate these nominees\nJust little fickle Jay-Z wannabes\nYou hobos are old and It's so so true\nNo promo, logo or photoshoot\nFuck your postcode, MOBO and polo suit\nMy opponents are hoping I won't go true\nIm certainly burning these burglars verbally\nMerking these merkers 'til mercenaries murder me\nBurstin' and turnin' your burberry burgundy\nGuernsey to Germany, Jersey to Bermondsey\nTrue rhymes, ain't got a pen? you can use mine\nAin't stayin' underground like a tube line\nI'mma come through and shine, In due time\nWhich one of you pricks said I can't do grime?You might also like10Embed"

Say can you see by the dawn's early light\n(Is it Obama's nation or an abomination?)\n(Is it Obama's nation or an abomination?)\nWhat so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming\n(Is it Obama's nation or an abomination?)\n(Doesn't make any difference when they bomb your nation)\nWhose broad stripes and bright stars through perilous fight\n(Is it Obama's nation or an abomination?)\n(Is it Obama's nation or an abomination?)\nO'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming\n(Is it Obama's nation or an abomination?)\n(Doesn't make any difference when they bomb your nation)\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe world's entertainer, the world's devastator\nFrom Venezuela to Mesopotamia\nYour cameras lie 'cause they have to hide the savage crimes\nCommitted on leaders that happen to try and nationalize\nEating competitions while the worlds been starvin'\nBeat up communism with the help of bin Laden\nWhere would your war of terror be without that man?\nEvery day you create more Nidal Hassans\nKill a man from the military, you're a weirdo\nBut kill a wog from the Middle East you're a hero\nYour country is causing screams that are never reaching ear holes\nAmerica inflicted a million ground zeros\nFollow the dollar and swallow your humanity\nSoldiers committing savagery you never even have to see\nThose mad at me, writing in emails angrily\nI'm not anti-America, America is anti-me\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nAnd the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air\n(Is it Obama's nation or an abomination?)\n(Is it Obama's nation or an abomination?)\nGave proof through the night that our flag was still there\n(Is it Obama's nation or an abomination?)\n(Doesn't make any difference when they bomb your nation)\nO! Does that star spangled banner yet wave\n(Is it Obama's nation or an abomination?)\n(Is it Obama's nation or an abomination?)\nO'er land of the free and the home of the brave\n(Is it Obama's nation or an abomination?)\n(Doesn't make any difference when they bomb your nation)\n\n[Verse 3]\nI don't care if him and Cheney are long lost relations\nWhat matters more is the policies, I lost my patience\nStop debating, bringing race into conversation\nOccupation and cooperation equals profit makin\nIt's over - people wake up from the dream now\nNobel peace prize, Jay-Z on speed dial\nIt's the substance within, not the colour of your skin\nAre you the puppeteer or the puppet on the string?\nSo many believed it was instantly gonna change\nThere was still Dennis Ross\nBrzezinski and Robert Gates\nWhat happened to Chas Freeman? (AIPAC)\nWhat happened to Tristan Anderson?\nIt's a machine that keeps that man breathing\nI have the heart to say what all the other rappers aren't\nWords like Iraq, Palestine, Afghanistan\nThe war's on, and you morons were all wrong\nI call Obama a bomber 'cause those are your bombs2Embed"

    "plain": "Lowkey raps about the difference of materialistic happiness and real happiness, coming to the conclusion that money doesn\u2019t make you happy.\n\nThe song features a sample of Lauryn Hill\u2019s \u201cTake Too Much\u201d and the beat is heavily based on this sample.\n\nIn the video, \u2018Key shows scenes from Havana, Cuba and a short text near the end attempts to highlight the injustice of the American blockade against Cuba and uses the Cuban people as an example for his point that happiness exists even where there is a lack of materialistic pleasure."

   "lyrics": "Alphabet Assassin Lyrics[Intro]\nYeah, the reunion\nSee, Papoose, he slaughtered the alphabet\nBut it's on life support\nSee me? I'm an assassin\nI finish the job every time\n\nA\nI'm an anarchist and an angry academic activist\nAxe and assassinate the alphabet in an ambulance\nAhki I'm aggy and I'm actually anti arrogant\nArtists that ask in american accents by accident\nB\nBatter babbling battlers with a bag of batteries\nBan these bias blaggers because they're badly backwards b\nBatty bible bashers get badded Basra to Brackenbury\nBaffle backpackers with bars bad as a big of b\n\nC\nCatty crackheads get cancelled Canada to Canterbury\nCussing my click catch a cavalry crashed into casualty\nA cunning culprit that covers conversation candidly\nCool calculated cannibal that causes carnage casually\n\nD\nDiddy didn't do diddly, dead it, did it with dignity\nYou dilly dally and diss from distance dig it I disagree\nYou did it for digits, dickhead dummy I do it differently\nI define deliberately diligent delivery\n\nE\nCoz everything is everything its evidence, my essence is every element\nEffortlessly edit your enterprise with eloquence\nElevate with the energy of Eminem\nEvery entity that's ever been a enemy I'm ending them\n\nF\nThe fact is I fracture factors to fragments fantastically\nFibbers fabricate fallacies and find fantasy\nI flip faithless fellas from fakers to flippin fans of me\nFlippantly famish and finish these fanatics factually\nYou might also likeG\nGive gangsters gangrene and gain green gradually\nGrapple and gatecrash your gathering with a gang of Gs\nGallivanting geezers get guided to the galaxy\nOr gallows for gambling with a generals geniality\n\nH\nI'll happily hack hackers that happen to have a hack at me\nLike Hatton I'm habitually hazardous how it has to be\nHospitalise haters from Holland, Holloway or Hackney\nHate hagglers and I hang 'em with a handkerchief\n\nI\nIllustrious illustrator\nIllest in the industry\nIllicitly cause illiterate idiots injury\nImpatient cause Illuminati impede my innovations\nWhile ignorant imbeciles idolise my imitations\n\nJ\nI jack a jackal for his jacket and just jam\nGot jittery jockeys jabbering, Jamaica to Japan\nGot jealous junkie jokers jabbing, January-to-January\nMy journal is a journey just don't jinx my jiggy jamboree\n\nK\nI'm the key, the king, the Kaiser, reminding my kin of karma\nI'm a kangaroo, keep in your kennel you curb koala\nKidnapping kleptomaniacs since kindergarten, killer\nKitties will give their kidney for a kit kat or a kipper\nL\nI'm a lyricist's lyricist, livid with little listeners\nListen, I'm loving living cause life is literally limited\nMy live lyrics lift lyricism levels luckily\nTil I leave the labyrinth of London and live in luxury\n\nM\nMeanwhile my motives to motivate and mobilise my monster men\nMy missions to minimise misdemeanours\nMere monuments of these midgets make me milli for minutes\nI may be a mad Mongrel and a manic Mesopotamian maniac\n\nN\nNo my narratives, not for narcoleptic narcissists\nNaive native nitwits natter negative nastiness\nNumerous naughty nymphos niggle up to my navel, no\nI neglect the negligee and navigate to Naples\n\nO\nWhen I operate, obsolete opposition get obliterated\nOften obese officers ogle as their occupation\nObviously offing other obstacles is my obligation\nOriginality over Oscar ovations\n\nP\nIt's Poisonous Poets, poised at the pulpit\nPulverise poachers and pointless posers\nWith potently poignant poems\nWe practically panic paparazzi\nPassive passengers just planning to pack P's and prang patchy pampering pansies\n\nQ\nQuality over quantity, qualify quantum physics\nI question quarrelly quacks and I quickly quadruple quizzes\nA quarter get queasy and query with queer quotes though\nThese quirky quibblers get crippled like Quasimodo\n\nR\nRighteous revolution ragamuffin repping reality\nReally rebelling, recruiting ready regiments rapidly\nRemorseless renegade, riddims and records ripping radio\nRapping rattlers really rally rating my ratio\n\nS\nI separately severed several stupid students for steppin\nAnd still slewing sacrilegious super sadists in seconds\nSpeak to Styz and savagely smack up studio sessions\nSuave swingers spitting sickest similes in seven\n\nT\nTopped the talent and tenacious tendencies of Tyson\nTipped as a terrifying terrorist tackling titans\nTokyo to Tennessee, taxing timid tourists\nThrough turbulent times I tangle with total torment\n\nU\nUnderstand I'm unbelievable, that's an understatement\nUglifier, giving ultimatums to undertakers\nUnanimous, undisputed, unfuckwithable\nUnforgiving to ugglesome uncles they're unoriginal\n\nV\nVerbally violent and victims validate my visions\nVaporising, vanish various vigilant villains\nVividly victorious over a variety of vixens\nVenomous viper vanquishes vampires with vengeance\n\nW\nThese wobbling wackos are just waiting to work for wages\nMy words are weapons willing to wage war on you wimpy wasters\n\nX\nI see through you xenophobic x-men with a x-ray\nEx out Xmas with a x-rated sex tape\n\nY\nThese yuppies are yapping\nI'm yawning, yearning for yesterday\nYears when youngers played with yo-yo's\nNot yet with y\u00e9\n\nZ\nI'm as zealous as Zeppelin and Zappa in my zones\nI zoom like Zorro I zap these zonking zebras, my zone's a zoo\n\nHow many letters left?\nZero5Embed"

Ahmed never hurt a fly\nAhmed never knew the politicians he was murdered by\nCertain times Ahmed wished that he could be a bird and fly\nBeyond the sky, escape the curse of birth that he was burdened by\nAhmed never grew to let your racism internalise\nWater poured from every pore in his corpse while the nurses cried\nAhmed was a beautiful person like you or I\nBut are we?..\nAhmed could have been a doctor, lawyer or an engineer\nCould have been a superstar but his life ended here\nGuess he was a shooting star, burn bright and disappear\nTo some he seems to represent a menace in this hemisphere\nLet me here make the very essence of this message clear\nHe was precious, many die like him every year\nAhmed was a victim of resentment and relentless fear\nNow his soul surfs the waves, I wish we could have kept him here\n[Hook: Lowkey & Mai Khalil]\nThe sea, the sea, the sea, it holds our secrets (holds our secrets)\nThe sea, the sea, the sea, it holds his soul (holds his soul)\nThey call him Ahmed\nThe sea, the sea, the sea, it holds our secrets (holds our secrets)\nThe sea, the sea, the sea, it holds his soul (holds his soul)\nThey call him Ahmed\n\n[Verse 2: Lowkey]\nAhmed's ancestors introduced to Europe Greek philosophy\nBrought with them irrigation, mathematics and astronomy\nSymbolically, irony of this horror isn't lost on me\nTrying to get to Europe via Greece is where he's lost at sea\nAhmed not Achmed, it's Ahmed, he's that dead\nToddler lying lifeless on the beach with his back bent\nArms spread, reaching the direction that his dad went\nIf he made it here, would have been bullied for his accent\nHe was captured by the ocean, paralysed and frozen\nWhile these parasites sat and typed, analysing clothing\nNow for resources we all compete beyond the talk of war and peace\nAnd talk of porous border there is corpses on the shore of Greece\nThey found a teddy next to where his body was found\nThe sea swallowed him, politics has swallowed him now\nAnd those responsible, Ahmed's ghost will follow them now\nTo the family all we can say is we are sorry he drowned\nBecause...\nYou might also like[Hook: Lowkey & Mai Khalil]\nThe sea, the sea, the sea, it holds our secrets (holds our secrets)\nThe sea, the sea, the sea, it holds his soul (holds his soul)\nThey call him Ahmed\nThe sea, the sea, the sea, it holds our secrets (holds our secrets)\nThe sea, the sea, the sea, it holds his soul (holds his soul)\nThey call him Ahmed\n\n[Bridge: Lowkey]\nThey say let him drown, let him drown, let him drown\nWhat have you done, don't let him drown, don't let him drown\nNo what have we become, don't let him drown\nNo, don't let him drown\nAnd they say\nLet him drown, let him drown, let him drown\nWhat have we done, don't let him drown, don't let him drown\nNo, what have we become, don't let him drown\nPlease, don't let him drown\n\n[Verse 3: Lowkey]\nAhmed could've been you, and Ahmed could've been me\nWe need to understand the policies that put him in the sea\nWe need to understand why it is the beach is full of dying kids\nA colonial Metropole people want to reside in\nIf he did would he make it or fall to something that's deeper\nEnd up like Jimmy Mubenga or Khaled Abu Zarifa\nA picture by Javier Bauluz on the beaches of Tarifa\nMade me see, some would grieve more if Ahmed was a creature\nWith four legs, then they would consider him legitimate\nThose like him braving barbed wire burning off their finger tips\nBalfours alien act, that mentality still exists\nIs privilege the difference between an ex-pat and an immigrant?\nFor Ama Sumani and Osman Rasul Mohamed, when you take others humanity, it's only yours that's stunted, not a swarm\nThey're our sisters and brothers, that's the sum of it\nThe cockroaches here are in the media and the government\nNot the sea\n[Hook: Lowkey & Mai Khalil]\nThe sea, the sea, it holds our secrets (holds our secrets)\nThe sea, the sea, the sea, it holds his soul (holds his soul)\nThey call him Ahmed\nThe sea, the sea, the sea, it holds our secrets (holds our secrets)\nThe sea, the sea, the sea, it holds his soul (holds his soul)\nThey call him Ahmed\n\n[Outro: Lowkey]\nAhmed never knew the politicians he was murdered by\nAhmed never knew the politicians he was murdered by\nAhmed never knew the politicians he was murdered by\nAnd they all laugh at him...1Embed"

   "lyrics": "The Return of Lowkey Lyrics[Intro: Duane Jones, Akala, Ghetts]\n'Cause (Yeah) there's a major demand for Lowkey material\nDo you think we're gonna get more Lowkey material in 2016?\nI dunno about in 2016\nBut I...I mean I...I would find it hard to believe that never in his life..\nSomeone naturally that talented\nThat brilliant an MC\nWith music just flowing through his veins\nI will be very surprised if he...if he never comes back\nLowkey is one of them people with them, like, energy, threat, can't beat\nCertain people's energies are off and I just think, we're on, we're on a different side spiritually\nOn a deeper ting, I just feel like you're on the other side spiritually\nWe can worry\n[Verse 1]\nYou could never top my Fire In The Booth\nI don't need a label; I'm signed to the truth\nIf you're a lion heart with the mind of a moose\nYour circle can hurt you as tight as a noose\nBars artillery, harsher than killer bees\nI'm a marksman with beats, carvin' 'em into meat\nPar mini mes, laugh at them in the street\nWanna spar the elite, hard for you to compete\nNot a marketin' dream, hearts in the Middle East\nStarvin' to eat, marger beyond belief\nWhere they martyr the meek, marchin' 'em into meet\nWith the arms of the beast, harvestin' with the teeth\nIf you're unhappy when you come at me, never miss\nMake you run scatty, dumb scallywags are gettin' dissed\nTrump rally with a gun carried in your fist\nThat's a punk patty and a chump chatty terrorist\nIntellect, still the sickest on the internet\nDidn't know that I'll kill you slow like a cigarette\nOut lyin', you get outlined like a silhouette\nBeen a vet, that didn't pet, the illest and I'm still a threat\nPersonified, verse at a time, merk 'em\nHeard all your rhymes, certain that I burn 'em\nEmerged in my prime, first to define to curtains\nIt's German, your ride hurtin' 'cause I'm Jurgen\nMurder the mic, klinsmann when I'm turnin'\nMerciless fight, Klansman when I'm verbin'\nWords that I write sting them when I'm burstin'\nWorst of my type, champion night nurse 'em\n'016, did a sold-out tour\nThink you know my life; I don't know about yours\nI was blackballed then, 'cause I spoke 'bout war\nThey want me closed down, but I spoke out more\nNow the silence is broken, virus is frozen\nCome to wash it away like the tide of the ocean\nMy pride is evolvin', size of a Trojan\nHorse on course to divide your emotion\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nGo rounds with the pen, the sound of a vet\nThey rouse me I'm killing 'em again-ga-ga-gen-gen\nThe album is next, it's foul that you slept\nMy mouth is weapon now again-ga-ga-gen-gen\nHow they forget, these cowards are vexed\nPound the alphabet again-ga-ga-gen-gen\nYou're out of your depth, bow to the best\nPut the crown on my head now again-ga-ga-gen-gen\n(We want Lowkey)\n(We want Lowkey)\n(We want Lowkey)\n(We want Lowkey, hear 'em calling out)\n(We want Lowkey)\n(We want Lowkey)\n(We want Lowkey)\n(We want Lowkey, hear 'em calling out)\n\n[Verse 2]\nSay you're sick, I'm prophylactic\nSay you're old school, I'm so Jurassic\nFlow galactic, gymnastic could hold a back flip\nKeep you grounded like drones at Gatwick\nBehold a classic, your poker tactics\nAre soulless and hopeless, you nosy actors\nMy mode of practise, is molten acid\nFlows roams the globe I control its axis\nNo foes in my lane, most of them are deranged\nHow you cope with pain, coke in up ya vein\nThey moulded your brain, culture killing the fame\nThey known of my name, 'spose it was gonna fade\nGet the concept, a monster lost like Loch Ness\nSilly flows all my videos are a boxset\nObsessed, with the nonsense, tell me what's next\nAnother day, I could run on stage like Offset\nOxford to Bangkok, jam pops off\nEven Amsterdam flow can pop clogs\nStand on hot rocks, still man's not hot\nGot genius bars like a laptop shop\nLook into the eyes of my son\nSee the moon shine and the rise of the sun\nShowed you my thumb, that's the size of your lung\nI love you and everything you'll strive to become\nI'm like Godzilla\nKids think they're sick but they're not iller\nHop in the mosh pit, I'm toxic the plot thickens\nHot spitter, couldn't give a toss if your watch ticking\nTop of the roster, eat monsters for hot dinner\nThe glitch in the matrix\nSpit with the greatness\nFlipping the script, my existence is dangerous\nConvincing the jaded\nNo stint with the majors\nMy fiscal's still sick, with no hits on the playlist\nMiserable haters\nThinking for ages\nHow to incriminate or intimidate him\nInk in my name is\nSinked in the pages\nPimps of the game want my fingerprints faded\nI wonder where the lyricism's gone?\nRidiculous how these kids are getting on\nI don't even listen to their lyrics when it's on\nDelete the whole app in the middle in the song\n[Chorus]\nGo rounds with the pen, the sound of a vet\nThey rouse me I'm killing 'em again-ga-ga-gen-gen\nThe album is next, it's foul that you slept\nMy mouth is weapon now again-ga-ga-gen-gen\nHow they forget, these cowards are vexed\nPound the alphabet again-ga-ga-gen-gen\nYou're out of your depth, bow to the best\nPut the crown on my head now again-ga-ga-gen-gen\n(We want Lowkey)\n(We want Lowkey)\n(We want Lowkey)\n(We want Lowkey, hear 'em calling out)\n(We want Lowkey)\n(We want Lowkey)\n(We want Lowkey)\n(We want Lowkey, hear 'em calling out)\n\n[Verse 3]\nIf everyland was wherever we stand\nAnd we never see dishevelled rebels heads in the sand\nDevils with terrible plans, metal they clench in their hands\nReady to embezzle the cheddar and cement of your fam\nSettle this land, weapons and gangs certainly plan to sever your every memory man\nIt's deadly and sad, they said to me, let it be together we stand\nDefending these energies of heavenly lands\nGuess who's back from the dead\nTime to scramble your head with a random event\nLike 2Pac, turned up to your nans on a ped\nWearing vans with a bandanna wrapped to his head\nYou might bang on the net, but you ran from my pen\nGrand stand, I'm Van Damme, mangle these men\nJackie Chan, with the damn hands, phantom for them\nDamp breddas with antennas get strangled again\nVanilla Ice, top floor dangling them\nTake it old school, bring a sandal for them\nIf you heard my bars thought that was a send?\nThen you better bring it back 'cause my friend\nI'm a vandal man, handle your ankle and bend\nWill you stand and defend or just scram for the fence\nWhen the massacre ends, I'll be back in the trench\nBetter practise your reps, 'cause you knackered and stressed\nThink your hot though, with your botched flow, but you're not bro\nGod knows, you could not blow, 'cause you flop shows\nCockroach with a snot nose and a lost soul\nDead sound it could get found in the Cotswold\nMic batterer, spine shatterer, rhyme patterner\nDefine badder and might splatter a hype challenger\nMalaga to Canada panic a sly manager\nRhyme Slazenger like daggers slice amateurs\nMy status is titanic, quite hazardous\nHigh cameras try tracking us, life's labyrinth\nRhymes raps to us like math to Pythagoras\nMy stamina's high calibre, try catching up\nClimb ladders to drop knowledge on top scholar\nI'm not modest, top dollars couldn't knock a rock solid\nGods honest truth in the booth I could stop sonic\nLock, stock and two smoking barrels in the box office\nRhymer and a ripper, Kaiza with a clipper\nLike Tyson when he bit him been a psycho since a nipper\nContemplating life like Michael in the mirror\n3, 2, 1 the word cypher came from sifr\n\n[Chorus]\nGo rounds with the pen, the sound of a vet\nThey rouse me I'm killing 'em again-ga-ga-gen-gen\nThe album is next, it's foul that you slept\nMy mouth is weapon now again-ga-ga-gen-gen\nHow they forget, these cowards are vexed\nPound the alphabet again-ga-ga-gen-gen\nYou're out of your depth, bow to the best\nPut the crown on my head now again-ga-ga-gen-gen\n\n[Outro: Akala, Bruce Real, Charlie Sloth]\nLabels should be beating down his doors\nThey wanna make money right?\nBut his political message is..is...just never gonna be played, never gonna be played on the radio\nNot marketable-\nBut that's the thing, it is marketable (Yes, okay)\nBecause, how is it he's able to sell, that amount of albums, and that amount of tickets, just off YouTube\nIf you don't wanna hear all that political shit, how...how is his success, or Immortal Technique's success, you know, how is that explainable\nThey tell us it's not marketable\nWhat they mean is, again, it doesn't fit with the agenda of the people who control the music industry\nIt's not about conspiracy\nWhat would be the consequences, if the song Terrorist for example, was that popular, just off a YouTube video\nWhat would the consequences if it was played daytime on Radio 1\nDo you think people would...would suddenly not like the song, not listen to it\nBut what he's saying is unacceptable to be played at that time of day, to that audience\nNot because it wouldn't resonate with them\nActually quite the contrary\nBecause if it resonates with them, what are the consequences?\nYour boy Charlie Sloth, the people's prince\nI'm here at The Garage on Holloway road\nRepresenting my boy, Lowkey\nFor the album launch, for the Soundtrack to the Struggle\nWhich I gotta say, in my humble opinion, is probably the best album of the year\nIt's probably, the best album in the last few years period\nAnd the fact that, you walk down the street, and you see the queue as crazy as it is\nI can't lie I got a little piece emotional\nI had to stand back, I had to take a deep breath, and I just had to look at the crowd\n'Cause it was real fucking emotional\nNow anybody that listens to my shows know I'm an avid supporter of Lowkey\nI have been from dot\nAnd, to see, how he's gone from strength to strength\nAnd built the, platform that he's built for himself\nWithout any, other DJ's really fucking with him\nAny, any financial backing\nNo major labels, no labels period\nIt's a beautiful thing man, like it is a beautiful beautiful beautiful thing\nAnd, I am honoured to be here tonight man\nLowkey is doing his damn ting7Embed"

Know what the answer is\nWho's got bars that carve to the heart of this?\nRegardless, I blame SB for starting this\nWhat's Fire in the Booth to an arsonist?\nGuys don't make me rap, guys don't make me rap\nGuys don't make me rap, might go crazy at\nWhat's Fire in the Booth to a pyromaniac?\nPlease bro, he don't need no heat though\nWhat's Fire in the Booth to the dragon Ricky Steamboat\nSeven years out, never fear doubt\nAny peers proud? Whatever the weather, better clear out\nYou're a mere mouse, I'm here now to tear down\nWhat you care about bears clout can never compare now\nBack worse than ever before, rebel with a cause you could never ignore\nIf anyone thought, I never dead it with metaphors that were better than yours\nI rendered the sentiments simple with source, and dead on the floors\nLet them have a bite, but that was bad advice if you fraternise\nKnow what man-a-man are like when a man on mic\nBattles bad as Bannon's like when hes banning guys\nHad enough of savage lies getting sanitised\nAsinine pantomimes got you paralysed\nGot a panoramic mind when I strategise\nAgonise, analyse before I spat a rhyme\nMerciless mystic, birth as a misfit\nJournalistic gift with the verbalist instinct\nThey heard that I did this, cursed as an infant\nBut burst with the verse, like the first in existence\nBillionaires, they don't want Corbyn in\nWe nearly are there, hit them with the four-kick spin\nThey're silly and scared, running on a forfeit ting\nHearing impaired, thinking I'm a Nordic King\nWe fought the cowards of corporate towers\nTryna force them out the corridors of power\nAnd the taste-makers were sort of sour\nVultures circle, leave your corpse devour\nBut I'm back now\n[Verse 2: The Redistribution of Power]\nPower to those that read bell hooks\nPower to those that sell books\nPower to those who know how the inside of a cell looks\nAll those feeling helpless, forgotten and discarded\nPower to the strange fruit they thought was rotten in the garden\nPower to those sitting alone, seeking solace in the calmness\nPower to those feeling stained, know your tomorrow isn't tarnished\nPower to those that sweep the streets with more knowledge than PhD's\nPower to those that keep their keys, return this promise, please believe\nPower to those that suffer in silence, those it hurts to hear\nPower to those that hold their ground\nPower to those that persevere\nPower to those that love humanity more than they love style\nPower to immigrants probably raising Donald Trump's child\nPower to the blind who can't imagine what sight is\nPower to those staring at the moon and all those working night-shifts\nPower to the readers, the writers, the illiterate\nPower to those that struggle to decolonise their syllabus\nPower to the shy ones, always struggle to make friends\nAnd the half of humanity worth less than eight men\nPower to those that risked their life to dig the coltan from the ground\nFor the mic I'm spitting on and the phone you're holding now\nPower to those that build the stadium they're playing in\nPower to those that mowed the grass and stitched the ball that they're playing in\nPower to every rapper that doesn't rap about killing\nPower to the builders who built buildings that outlived them\nPower to the slaves of Ancient Greece that didn't have the right to vote\nDemocracy dead like Gary Webb, when they import it like its coke\nPower to those write to prison\nPower to those writing home\nPower to those writing poems\nPower to those that died alone\nPower to Curtis Mayfield\nPower to Ronald Isely\nPower to the fishermen that were forced into piracy\nPower to every person that is working in a library\nPower to every nurse that we turn to in our times of need\nPower to the unions and the mindless Thatcher punished\nPower to those that drive the busses and those that collect the rubbish\nPower to the youth desiring the truth\nPower to every rapper that is dying for a Fire in the Booth\nFor those that lost limbs to King Leopald's quota\nAnd those risking their lives for the P&O to Dover\nPower to union leaders murdered by [coca-cola]\nPower to victims of this globalised cosa nostra\nPower to those dying on the shores and the borders\nPower to humanbeings that were rendered fauna and flora\nPower to those that cleaned up after the stage show\nAnd Carnival goers still haunted by Kelso Cochrane's ghost\nPower to ... his picture taunts us ever after\nSo many questions never answered\nRemember the last words of Abdul-Muhsin Al-Saadoun, \"\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0629 \u062a\u0646\u062a\u0638\u0631

killed his brother Ja'far and he cursed the rotten Thamesians\nEnlighten despots pursuing tactics Machiavellian\nChinese still preceded Europa millennium, think about it\nPrinted press half a millennium never get close\nPower to Ken Loach and every volunteer in Lesbos\nCuban doctors sent to Sri Lanka for the tsunami\nPower to those that cleaned up after the Bullingdon parties\nKids knowing Apple products before they know what an apple is\nForgotten like passengers on the USS Indianapolis\nDying days, for they could see what little boy's damage did\nOn the precipice of fascism, our passiveness is cancerous\nPower to those still strong enough to dream\nPower to those that chose not to be a cog in the machine\nPower to those that love first and hate never\nPower to those that sleep on the streets through grey weather\nPower to Aziz Ali and Bone Thugs-n-Harmony\nPower to Norman Baker, David Kelly's, ulnar artery\nPower to the genocided population of Tasmania\nThe internet descends to Trumptastic fantasia\nLet them try quote this\nYou'll never find a better diagnosis than collective psychosis\nIt's getting quite hopeless but hope is all we have\nTryna cultivate the positive, not focus on the bad\nBut the globe's under attack\nThe obnoxious rage of a fake intellectual\nAmazing grace in the age of the spectacle\nNot the first time they found a racist electable\nTo raise to the pedestal\nThen desecrate the place that translated the decimal\nI don't wanna tempt fate\nPower to corpse-washers like Salvador Allende\nPower to language learners\nFrom Bernie Sanders fans to flag-burners\nOne man's inertia is another man's purpose\nIn the utopia of song, we are victorious\nBut the bitter sweet reality is not this glorious\nPower to Coltrane watching Malcolm X\nPower to Paul Robeson under house-arrest\nPower to Galileo under house-arrest\nPower to Ibn Haytham under house-arrest\nForgive me if I sound obsessed\nForgive me if I sound depressed\nBelieve me, that's not how it's meant\nThey probably think I couldn't come back and kill the alphabet\nYou might also like[Verse 3: Before Orientalism]\nAl-Khwarizmi estimated the circumference of the globe\nAt a time when Europe thought the earth was flat\nAnd couldn't tell the time of day, the astrolabe paved the way\nFor the clock now I'm about to turn it back\nWas the qanoon of Ibn Sina perceived as backwards\nWhen Oxford scholars deemed bathing a heathen practice\nHistory from Aristotle to Al-Kindi as we gather\nInnovations of Ibn Haytham to da Vinci and the camera\nAsk Roger Bacon, Galileo and Adelard of Bath\nIbn Shatir before Copernicus, century and a half\nHouse of wisdom, books waiting gold, answers to conundrum's chain\nCheng Ho sailed the sea before da Gama and Columbus\nYou are not who they say you are, you're blessed with a choice\nHere since the 700's, look at King Offa\u2019s coins\nYou can do whatever it is that you wanna do\nThere's a crater named after Al-Ma'mun on the moon\nCivilisations build on each other, not each to their own\nMy question: If people are equal like the teeth of a comb\nWere Jahiz, Mansa Musa, Malik Najashi; Abeed\nI didn't think so but it seems Shaabi, nasi what I need\nCheck yourself, check Raphael's depiction of Ibn Rushd\nThink twice, study history, give it a different look\nCurriculum's literally littered with pitfalls of ridicule\nFatima al-Fihri founded one of the oldest still-existing schools\nIt's deeper than some rhymes I'm providing for the listener\nNo surprise for a spitter, the word cypher came from \u1e63ifr\nIs the next Younis Mahmoud among four million orphaned babies?\nWhat if Yusra Mardini wasn't able to swim to safety?\nIt could be Steve Jobs is starving under hisar\nIt would be Zaha Hadid just died in an infijar\nThrough your blood flows Gilgamesh and Abu Nuwas\nYour future's bigger than the pain or your present and your past\nWe strive to be free\nFanon struggled for independence he wasn't alive to see\nThe countrification, alienation, souls left so scarred\nIdarat altawahish decapitations on postcards\nThe occupier left behind all forms of stigma\nInsidious settlement of the mind is more malignant\nFrom the ashes of war, no phoenix, that human is lost\nThey learnt idarat altawahish from ensuing the cost\nThey learnt resistance from Morheeba Korshid\nAnd Lela Khaled learnt about Jamal from Bu Azza, Abu Basha and Bouhired\nIf Abdelkader was reburied in Al-Jaza'er that's the\nProof return will come for the diaspora of the nakba\nNot the first or the last to break free from the gillotine\nYesterday Aljazair, tomorrow Philistine\nNot the first or the last to break free from the gillotine\nYesterday Aljazair, tomorrow Philistine\nMy love letter to the past, this is my love letter to the future\nThis is my love letter from the heart, 'cause you don't know how beautiful you are\nMy love letter to the past, this is my love letter to the future\nThis is my love letter from the heart, 'cause you don't know how beautiful you are3Embed"

    "plain": "\u201cGhosts of Grenfell\u201d is a tribute song in response to the Grenfell Tower tragedy that occurred in London on June 14, 2017. Lowkey, who is known for his mixture of social commentary and political content in his songs, has been vocal about this incident in interviews since it has occurred.

Lowkey, who is known for his mixture of social commentary and political content in his songs, has been vocal about this incident in interviews since it has occurred. This song serves a purpose to raise awareness of the event and remind people of the unclear circumstances surrounding it and of the lives that were lost.\n\nAs the song ends, we hear the names of those still missing but are still not part of the official figures of those confirmed dead (as of 9 August 2017)."

It was released as a single in December 2009.\n\nLowkey is a Muslim of Iraqi descent.\n\nInteresting fact is that Lowkey was detained and interrogated no less than two times by Israeli officials upon arrival at Ben Gurion Intl Airport in Israel."

the intifada\nListen close I've got six words for Obama\nLong live Palestine\nLong live Gaza\nPalestine, Ramallah, West Bank, Gaza\nIt's about time we globalized the intifada\nListen close I've got six words for Obama\nLong live Palestine, Long live Gaza\n[Verse 1: Lowkey]\nThe government supports the people of the UK didn't\nZionism is not compatible with Judaism - the hijacked faith\nThe state is misrepresenting\nIsrael equals misplacement and ethnic cleansing\nI know I'm on a list, for being more verbal, curse every Zionist since Theodor Herzl\nBalfour was not a wise man\nShame on Rothschild\nBetween them the monster they created has gone wild\n\n[(Arabic Translation) Verse 2:Tamer Naffar (DAM)]\nWe are people who were sieged by the enemy\nBetrayed by our brothers\nYou won't feel heroic [?]\nWithdrawal from Iraq, like a locust invasion\nLeft only destruction\nNo punishment\nHow many mouths were silenced?\nHow many mothers left devastated?\nMy freedom begins when the one who took it pays the price\nMr. Judge, open your eyes, open your ears\nHow many evidences scream against him...\nGive me my freedom, and tie up his hands\n\n[Verse 3: The Narcicyst]\nTears to laughter\nOur children don't fear disaster\nLiving near the master\nClear the facts\nHear the casket\nWe rap and we die from bombastic times\nLoons have to hide\nSummer days in the thunder blaze\nThey merk their dreams like Theodor Herzl screams\nAnd the UN and 48 Third Intifada\nFrom mothers, daughters\nSons martyred and empty fathers\nYou might also like[(Arabic Translation) Verse 4: Eslam Jawwad]\nThe right of returned\nA whole people got imprisoned\nBullets are falling like rain\nRain is falling hard\nBreaths are cut\n[?]\nTake the bird out of its cage\nGo fly away\nGo show my blood to the world\nThis is my sin\nI'm waiting for my Savior, for Isa\nThe only hope I have left is my God\n\n[(Farsi lyrics) Verse 5: Hichkas]\n\u0628\u0627 \u0627\u06cc\u0646\u06a9\u0647 \u062a\u0648

you go\nFree Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine\nFree Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine, Free Free Palestine\n\n[Verse 6: Reveal]\nIsrael is a terrorist state\nThe evidence is quite obvious\nWar criminals using lethal weapons like white phosphorus\nBurns your flesh to the bone\nAnd if you happen to live\nYou'll be left infected with cancer\nYou'll curse the fact that you did\nForgive me if I wish to say fate on those Israelis\nResponsible for killing all those innocent little babies\nI studied the Torah and learnt by their own admission\nIsrael's actions are not kosher in their own religion\n\n[(Arabic Translation) Verse 7: Mahmoud Jreiri (DAM)]\nI look around me, I find no life\nThey took my land from under my feet\nAnd gave me only suffering\nWe used to carry \"Torreyeh\" (A planting tool)\nAnd God gave us our livelihood\nNow we carry a rifle\nAnd on God we depend\nMassacre, Slaughter\nEveryone has seen it on the screens\nNot today, not the West Bank, not Gaza\nLook closely in the pages of history\nLook at Christ\nPeople are getting crucified in Palestine for over 60 years\n\n[Verse 8: Hasan Salaam]\nThe Devils got an unholy plan for the Holy Land\nSo I hold my Quran and\nCulture power in the other hand\nDamn\nNo oasis just bloodstained sands\nSettlements settin' up to eliminate child, woman and man..\nThere's no such thing as the Middle East\nBrother they deceiving you\nNo matter where you stand there's always something to the east of you\nSo whether it's the Mossad or the FBI policing you\nIt's all one struggle till the final breath is leavin' you\n\n[(Arabic Translation) Verse 9: Shadia Mansour]\n(We should, Know, How, [?])\nArabic people, our unity is our skeleton\nWe should learn how to think\nWe should learn how to deliver a message without shutting doors in our faces\nI wouldn't have known what is good for me\nIf I haven't seen what is good for others\nTake my words as

   "lyrics": "Fire in the Booth (Part 2) Lyrics[Intro]\nYou know what time it is when you hear this right\n[\"Stillmatic\" instrumental]\nYeah, Fire in the Booth, much anticipated Part 2\nHold tight suspense, listen\nIf they don't let us dream then we won't let them sleep\nIf they don't let us dream then we won't let them sleep\nListen\n\n[Verse - Alphabet Assassin Part 2]\nIt's the zeitgeist, Zapatista, Zorro at his zenith\nZ of zinc in the zebra zig-zagging zealots\nZilch to zombies and Zionists he's zen in his zodiac\nFire in the booth? It's Zoroastrian the zone he's at\nLike yapping like Yokozuna in Yemen youtubing yoga\nOr Yokozuna in Yeovil yodelling in Yoruba\nThey yelling your yardstick of yesteryear like Yeboah\nThey're yearning, I'm yawning this like a yeti vs Yoda\nI\u2019m an X-ray you're Xerox, I'm Xavier to the x-men\nEx out xmas like your Xanax to an extent\nA wonderful world is waiting while weapons wage war we're weeping\nWho's winning? We're wishing well while wicked wizards webs were weaving\nThey whip us 'til we're wheezing\nOur Words of wisdom won't weaken\nWitness these whatlass witless wallies waffling with their weekend\nTheir wording is Wikipedia virtually void of vitals\nVerses visceral\nVintage but vivid videos going viral\nI'm your uncle that understands\nNow it\u2019s us with the upper hand\nWe were underlings underrated unhuman to Uncle Sam\nThe theory teaches that there are those thinking tactics to take the throne\nThough the truth tends to be told\nThrough their thesaurus it takes its toll\nSlivering snakes stipulate systems to sell your soul\nSecretly seek social stratification set in stone\nRegiments ravaged the region now its ripe for reparations\nRendered refugees can't retract or repair ramifications\nOn a quest to quash the quarrels I\u2019m quintessentially qualified\nQuitters quake the quality of my quotes can't quite be quantified\nPeople pass prematurely and pay the price for passivity\nPretext to pillage, plunder prepare to prolong proximity\nA puppets pathology pulverized by these possibilities\nPeople power is potent and the peak of positivity\nOligarchs ostracise others offer obituaries\nOverall I overstand the odyssey optimistically\nThe norms of a nascent nation should never negate nature\nNasty as nefarious neo-con naysayers for neighbours\nThis masterful maverick mic man, will make you meet your maker\nMeanwhile merciless mercenaries manoeuvre to meet to the majors\nLyrically lacklustre literally lack love\nLust living lavish in luxury listeners lap up\nA kaleidoscope of kindness, knowledge, knuckles and kerosene\nTo kill the kleptocracy and cool the kettle that they kept us in\nJabbing javelins at jingoism\nJealousy justified when jeering at jobless is journalism\nInformation industry interlinked with infantry\nInstrumentalise identity implant ignorance instantly\nHackers in handcuffs, harvesters of hatred hand gliding\nHarbingers of harassment harbour harmful handwriting\nGangsters of globalisation glorify glitz and the glam\nGive us guidance to the graveyard they got the gift of the gab\nIt's flawless how they fabricate the folklore of the fiefdom\nFunnell funds to freelance fighters and fawn over fights for freedom\nEntertainment is education, empathy is eccentric\nEconomics everything, exploitation an epidemic\nExhausting environment is easy but the dividends are deadly\nDon't dare dream of doing different dread our destruction is definitely\nComing as the catalysts clamour for capital\nCan't counteract the cycle this catastrophe could cancel all\nBring borders to bear bombarded with the broken\nBasically bribery beckons business we are beholden\nThough accurate answers to all of the above aren't available\nI attack the alphabet again and aced it just to aim at you\nThey say anything is attainable\nAttack the alphabet again and ace (it just to aim at you)\n[\"Beautiful Mind\" instrumental]\n[Verse 2]\nIf they don't let us dream, then we won't let 'em sleep\nIf they don't let us dream, then we won't let 'em sleep\nHow can I do a fire in the booth, when I'm trying just to maintain\nAnd since June don't hear the word fire in the same way\nHeard screams, splutters and them gasping for air\nThat\u2019s not bars in a booth it\u2019s so hard to compare\nIf I use fire as metaphor\nDoes that disrespect the people that are never more?\nHow does that bomb sound sound to those that bled in war that we never saw?\nRemember when they settled scores with metal swords like Skeletor\nChinese made gun powder, Nobel invented dynamite\nThey say the guilt in his mind compelled him to design the prize\nWe know what Einstein's mind was like\nHow many geniuses we never knew that were deprived of life?\nI can't philosophise on horrifying flames\nWe don\u2019t have to apologise or qualify our pain\nDegrenfellise our loved ones of the colonisers name\nShould we let the corporate media lobotomise our brains\nYou are beautiful, no matter how this life disfigures you\nYou\u2019re beautiful even if that image you emulate isn't you\nI don\u2019t know if history is linear or cyclical\nBut know I\u2019m ridiculed for making invisibles visible\nThat's why Plato said banish poets from the republic\n\u2018Cause they know that we can shake the social system and disrupt it\nThe land of liberty, they tell us leave it or lump it\nWhen Trump comes to the country we hope he chokes on his crumpet\nBefore we sink in the ocean, consider this as an omen\nNatures blessings aren't ours just \u2018cause we think that we own them\nNever think that you're broken, or think that you're no-one\nRemember a rope is strong because of strings interwoven\nWould they love you more if you mock the people that you're from\nSelf-orientalise and believe that you belong\nOvercompensate and propagate the image of the imbecile\nNot uninvolved though you're further from the killing field\nTake solace in the fact there's always cracks in the monolith\nNow we're practically lobbing bricks like Asterix and Obelix\nDistracted with gossip it's twisted news an interlude to adverts no hidden truths to listen to it's pitiful\nRosa Luxemburg gave us this simple truth\nYou won't feel your chains till the day you begin to move\nHe photographed a corpse and they flung him in the cage\nThose that signed off on the cladding are still receiving their wage\nHelicopters hovered close, pictures for the front page\nTried to speak all I really felt deep was numb rage\nHow could they see this pain at such a young age\nLeaning out the window, screaming for help but none came\nIf it bleeds it leads, trauma tourists they gravitate\nShock doctrine in effect, disaster capitalists salivate\nPrivitisation, deregulation and austerity\nTo zero hour contracts, exploitation and precarity\nAdults didn't make it, children to be fostered\nSaved pennies on the block, dropped 20 million on the opera\nWe see through your cold plans, your programme is done\nWe don't want a Prime Minister that holds hands with Trump\nWe don't want DJs doing shows on military compounds\nCan't trivialise fire or hear any more bomb sounds\nHow can I smile when I know the remains are still not found\nAnd echoing in my mind is exactly how the sobs sound\nThey say we're criminals for the syllables and stanzas\nWhen they subsidise the killers tools, the pillagers and bankers\nWho are the engines of history, people like me and you\nWho got massacred for the right to vote at Peterloo\nIt was imagineers, the poets and the artists\nThe miners, Tolpuddle Martyrs, William Cuffay and the chartists\nRebel and resist even through something small\nCreate windows with words and mirrors where once were walls\nManure contributes to the beauty of a rose\nWhy can't we accept our pain as something that helps us grow\nThey wonder why songs that make you cry are more moving\n\u2018Cause crying's the only thing that we were born doing\nThey tell us tea is tradition to the English\nWhen I look around this island not a tea plantation in it\nEarl Gray gave 20 million to the slave traders\nMulti-polar world now the Indians are space raiders\nFreedom to be even or merely alienate labour\nFreedom for fossil fuellers to desecrate and invade nature\nAlbert was an immigrant, Prince Phillip is an immigrant\nWere the Celts, Normans and the Anglo-Saxons English, then?\nThe words Sugar, Cotton and Rice come from Arabic\nNow we import democracy to civilise the Saracens\nAnalysing planets when this back water was wilderness\nIt seems we're still obsessed with immortality like Gilgamesh\nPessimism of intellect, optimism of will\nWear the skin of their victims its syndrome buffalo bill\nIn times of permanent war there is always someone to kill\nBut when life and death are virtual almost nothing is real\nThey got my snapshots in a padlocked box\nSettle with the heavy metal this is rap not rock\nIt's fire in the booth but man's not hot\nI just got genius bars like a laptop shop\nThey wanna know if I've got a flow, or I'm gonna blow\nBack like Geronimo Pratt let's rock \u2018n roll\nI never sold my soul for a pot of gold\nNow feel this scholar\u2019s solid knowledge in your collar bone\nSubject of propaganda, that terrifies the slumbered\nBut the albums still sell you can verify the numbers\nCollectivise or die, protect your mind or suffer\nLife is paradise to some and a pair of dice to others\nWhile these twittering teens, are sinking in screens and thinking in memes\nThey blink and this machine is pimping their dreams\nI think it\u2019s obscene, as sick as it seems\nThey don\u2019t know what lyrical invincibility means\nBarge through for part 2, I can't lose\nLabels astroturfing trying to make it look grass roots\nGone are the days we sold our CDs from the car boot\nA sharpshooter shooting harpoons through your chart tunes\nI saw pain in the eyes of a tired retired fire man\nKnowing he couldn't save a child survive the frying pan\nWhen we riot we disquiet the leviathan\nForget iron man I got an iron lion\u2019s diaphragm\nMy salutation to those with imagination\nMost anticipated and that's no exaggeration\nThe flag doesn't exist let me back up that statement\nWhat happens to the nation, if the Queen has a tax haven?\nWhat's commonsensical is sensible to question\nWhat seems to be a lesson is intellectual repression\nSay the ting goes\u2026 as expression of aggression\nRemember there are two victims on either side of the weapon\nWe won\u2019t let \u2018em sleep\nIf they don't let us dream, then we won't let them sleep\nIf they don't let us dream, then we won't let them sleep...\nListen, check it\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nPower to those who read bell hooks\nPower to those who sell books\nPower to those who know how the inside of a cell looks\nAll those feeling helpless, forgotten or discarded\nPower to the strange

the ground\nFor the mic I\u2019m spitting on and the phone you\u2019re holding now\nPower to those that built the stadium they're playing in\nPower to those that mowed the grass and the stitched the ball that their playing with\nEvery rapper that doesn\u2019t rap about killing\nPower to the builders who build buildings that outlived them\nPower to the slaves of ancient Greece that never had the
