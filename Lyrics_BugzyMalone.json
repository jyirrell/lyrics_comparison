  "plain": "Bugzy Malone (Real name Aaron Davies) is a rapper from Manchester.\nHe has released multiple mixtapes and gained fame after appearing in his Fire in the Booth on BBC Radio 1Xtra in 2015 which is currently the most viewed Fire in the Booth with over 26 million views. The video gained the Mancunian mass recognition due to his meaningful lyrics and his send for the rapper, Chip. This started a large beef between them with Bugzy making the diss-tracks Relegation Riddim, The Revival, Wasteman and Zombie Riddim\n\nThis feud with Chip was a pivotal moment in Bugzy Malone\u2019s career, leading to him gaining recognition and increasing his fanbase  (along with sales of his infamous \u201cManny on the Map\u201d shirts). This led him to score #8 on the UK Albums Chart with his EP, Walk with Me in 2015. Bugzy Malone then released his next EP titled Facing Time the following year and continued this tradition by releasing King of the North in July 2017, which peaked at number 4 in the UK Albums Chart, being Bugzy\u2019s highest ranking album to date.\n\nDue to the popularity of his music and his clothing, Bugzy Malone decided to release an album titled B. Inspired along with his brand new clothing range in September 2018."

Bugzy uses this tune to tell his side of that story."

   "lyrics": "M.E.N Lyrics[Intro]\nBugzy Malone\nYou know\nMr SnoWman on production\n\n[Verse 1]\nWatch this, I got a brand new three bedroom crib\nSpotlights in the ceiling it's sick\nGot a beanbag in the computer room\nAll I need now is Grand Theft Auto: Six\nGot an office and everything cocaine white\nIn the morning it can get too bright\nBut it doesn't affect me these days 'cause I've been staying up way too deep in the night\nThinking about before it all went bad\nBefore the day I met my real dad\nBefore I knew about money and bills and how they both made my mum get sad\nSat counting about twenty-five bags\nI'm running out of elastic bands\n'Cause It turns out, when you make money on the road there's nothing you can do with the cash\nSo I jump in the S-Line driving fast\nHope I don't bump into my step-dad\n'Cause they say mental abuse is worse than physical abuse and I wanna get him back\nBut I don't wanna do another custodial sentence\nIn a four-by-four pad\nAnd I gotta take this time to apologise to my best friend 'cause we almost crashed\nLet me try and explain\nIt's intricate because I've never been plain\nIt's intimate because I never contacted a counsellor to get rid of this pain\nI walk with it and now I'm going insane\nLosing control of my own brain\nWatching documentaries on serial killers and feeling that I can relate\nDo you find that strange?\nYeah? Ok. Well let me get this straight\nIf I get a life sentence or I don't make it, it's 'cause I could not handle the pain\nI don't wanna hear nobody complain\nAbout that's good talent gone to waste\n'Cause if I didn't go through what I went through, you would have never downloaded my mixtape\n[Verse 2]\nSo let me confide in you\nLet me get it off my chest\nTurns out no matter how many tracks I make I still can't handle the stress\nBut I don't watch all the indirect's\nTrue say man might see me as a threat\nI don't mind going out as a legend as long as I'm known as Manchester's best\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo picture the scene:\nI'm sitting on my corner sofa in peace\nUntil I got a call: \"Have you seen yourself in the papers? You're wanted by the police\"\nAnd I was like what? And it was hot. But do you wanna know what was a lot?\nThe night before was the night I went on Twitter and had a direct message from Sloth\nJust my luck\nLet me do a Vincent Van Gogh\n'Cause you know I paint pictures with words\nAnd I've still not published one book\nI was in Panacea tryna get to the bar\nAnd my man didn't wanna let me past\nPushed me into a family of brothers\nBefore you knew it I'd already been cracked\n\n[Verse 4]\nBut let me remind these fools\nInto the devil I turn\nThey stepped back, I stepped forward, play with fire, and you're gonna get burned\nBut I must apologise in advance 'cause I didn't want it to end so bad\nSee what happened from there was loose\nI was in the Manchester Evening News\nHe said he got violently attacked\nOutside in a taxi, he was whacked, and coulda died\nBut that's how you know what the papers tried, it was self-defence, that's a blatant lie\nI'm stereotyped\nAnd do you wanna know why, I'm a different guy\nWhen I was about eight, my mum moved to an area that was heavily white\nI was in school looking like Wesley Snipes\nBen Shermans and a second-hand bike\nFeeling like a doughnut cause I'd already been stabbed by the time I was year nine\nMum didn't want me to see Moss Side\nTold me that too many people died\nBetween like '91 and '99 there was a gang war and violent crime\nMy uncle's face got torn out by the pellets of a shotgun like Frankenstein\nI was sat with him in an M3 that could do 0-60 in 4.5\nOne hand holding the steering wheel\nMoving quicker than the Batmobile\nDriving around Cheetham Hill when I was about nine\nBack when the hood was real\nYou might also like[Verse 5]\nA villain, taken Securicor boxes\nAnd I don't care if it's hot\nThey don't mean Russell Crowe when they mention the gladiator in the gang war book\nThe first guy that I ever looked up to he was like Batman without the suit\nNow it's my turn to try and put Manny on the map, I just hope I can do it like you\nHope I can get one million views\nHope that I never get caught with food\nI hope that Charlie can breathe alright in the smoke\n'Cause I set fire to the booth\nWhen I realised that grime was English hip hop forget about all the tunes\nForget the playlist I wanna go down in history like Tutankhamun\nBugzy Malone\n\n[Outro]\nLeave that playing\nI dedicate this one to Dane\nMy little cousin\nHe didn't make it\nRest in Peace, my fam\nSee you soon, my brudda19Embed"

   "lyrics": "Fire in the Booth Lyrics[Verse 1: Bugzy Malone]\nDrove past my mum's old house on Bury New Road\nThe one she got evicted from\nWent to McDonald's\nOrdered a cheeseburger and chips on an addicted one\nThen I heard: \"Can I get a picture?\"\nStood there and I took fifteen pictures, don\nWith fifteen different kids\nI was there on the phone but I left tongue twisted, don\nI know I paint pictures with words\nBut I didn't know I was the gifted one\nAnd now they say I put Manny on the map\nSo I hashtag 0161\nDrove back past my mums house\nLooked through the window on a reminiscent one\nShouldn't have done that\nCus now I'm having flashbacks of the days when I had hectic fun\nOn Super Mario, Donkey Kong\nAnd I was on my Nintendo all day long\nI could hear loud shouting downstairs\nBack and forth like ping pong\nThe gift came with a curse\nEver since ten years old my head's been gone\nNow I wanna climb to the top of the Empire State Building\nJust like King Kong\nHad problems with the DVLA so I was on the bus arriving late\nBut now the S-Line floats like a butterfly\nI'm feeling like Cassius Clay\nBut I'm not a heavyweight\nThe only thing heavy is the weight of the world on my shoulder\nI used to be afraid of an older until I put five bullets in a revolver\nI was cold then, now I'm colder\nI was voice note lyrics you write in a folder\nI'll build up your lyrics into a rizzla\nAnd blaze them like I was a stoner\nIf you see me and I'm sober\nThinkin', know that I'm an imploder\nThat means I hold it in but if I explode\nI'll be like Vinegar and Baking Soda\nJesus\nI've got them thinking 'is this guy from Manchester?'\nThe wordplays heavy just like Sylvester\nAnd I'm takin' over like I'm on a Vespa\nAnd when I say I've got boxes of cheese\nI'm not talking about Red Leicester\nAnd why do I laugh at MC's?\nA king will always laugh at a Jester\nA Porsche will always pass a Fiesta\nYou're lookin' at Manchester's best\nI'm from a place where nobody's impressed\nAnd don't wanna see nobody progress\nSo they take shots at my ego\nBut I got a built-in stab-proof vest\nI've been stabbed in the back so much\nI'm like Jesus in the Passion of Christ\nI was sat countin' about twenty-five grand\nI got delusional\nThe Queen started talking\nI was like: \"Queen, why is everyone warring?\"\nShe said: \"Politics are boring\"\nCause it's all propaganda\nAnd comes down to the fact that money's more important\nThan poverty and feeding the poor\nThe rich get rich, we get ignored\nMiddle-class people\nThat have done everything that the Government told 'em\nStruggle to pay bills\nCause when they go to the bank they say their accounts been frozen\nSo damn right I'm taking doors off hinges\nI'm running in through the hallway\nHolding a big boy sword like a Viking\nBut I never been from Norway\nAnybody comes at me\nI stick it right in\nCus I don't do foreplay\nI make a man bleed sick\nSo he looks like Tomato Puree\nYou're lookin' at Bugzy Malone\nEvery video is a new part of my story\nAnd I was born back in 1990\nSo were on about episode forty\nI say look when I'm spittin'\nCause I spit bars in high definition\nIt's like watching a widescreen television\nAnd this one here's like 007, why?\nCause I'm on a one-man mission\nTo put my town on the map I'm reppin'\nBut I'm worse than a Nuclear weapon\nCause I'll make your whole town go missing\nI know when I've said suttin' sick\nWhen I see a man's head start tiltin\nI'm like Wolverine from the X-Men\nCus the metal is built in\nI've not set fire to the booth\nI've set fire to the whole building\nCharlie was gonna jump out the window\nCause the smoke in the room could've killed him\nDrove past my mum's old house on Bury New Road\nThe one I got evicted from\nDrove straight past\nOnto the motorway and straight into the distance don\nLooked in the rear view mirror\nThinking about the past, on a majestic one\nCause if I didn't go through what I went through\nThen I probably woulda never wrote this song\n[Verse 2: Bugzy Malone]\nThere's a lot to be said\nLot to be told, lot to be confessed\nI'm holdin' doe\nSo I'm overly stressed\nI wear my hat low\nCah' I'm known to the Feds\nTryna be cool\nBut I'm losin' my head\nPlus I heard a couple man wanted me dead\nTell them, man, we got the machine\nAnd I see them when they get out the pen\nFuck music I see them when they hit road\nI be on your TV, in your stereo\nI be in your Blackberry, in your iPhone\nEverybody knows about Bugzy Malone\nBut I gotta confess\nIn '010 I fell off\nMade ten quid\nMade bare man jealous\nSpent every penny in about six weeks\nBut I don't care\nNow that I'm back well off\nFuck bitches I just do big bits\nI'm just tryna get rid of boxes like Kellog's\nSo I can get the Kawasaki Ninja\nMatte Black\nI'm a rider, and they forgot\nMe a Machine, Ninja\nRed hot\nTell my man I'll take his head off\nI'd die for my family\nAnd that's on my mum's life\n\u2018Did they forget Dee\u2019s my Brudda\u2019\nDid they forget I come from the gutter\nAnd I spent '07 in the slammer\nNever seen the summer\nThey let me out\nAnd a ate man like I never had a dinner\nPray to the Lord like I never been a sinner\nTake off a front door like I'm onto a winner\nGamble my freedom\nEvery day I wake up\nYou would've thought I was a Roulette spinner\nI go inner they just go in\nI'm Bugzy Malone the wickedest 'ting\nSince Lucifer dropped with a broken wing\nThey spill the beans like a open tin\nBut I'm ODT, so I'm on dis 'ting\nTell them Gunchester run this 'ting\nI fuck them up with the 'ting in their mouth\nI make their legs shake, bondage 'ting, yo'\nI'm the general, front-line soldier\nRun this grime 'ting ten times over\nGo tell Chipmunk not to be cheeky'\nGrime is a road 'ting, my man's hopeless\nGo make a pop tune, fuck your A's and B's\nYou went from Chip Diddy Chip to The Streets\nOopsy Daisy, I'm not in your league\nWell I've been on the road playing Hide and Seek\nHide from the Feds, seek my enemies\nIt's like I got some freaky disease\nCause when I say: \"Turn into the Devil\"\nIt's like bare bitches drop to their knees\nI've been dissecting boxes of cheese\nSince I was eighteen, I had five workers\nThat's five phones, five days in, we made five g's\nThat's two grand profit\nHave you gone mad?\nI made ten grand in about five weeks\nThat's no secret, man know me\nBugzy Malone's not just an MC\nI got locked up aged sixteen\nSo fuck Chipmunk 'n' his A's n B's\nI rep this grime 'ting properly, 0161\nWatch how they walk with me, trust me\nWatch how they walk with me\nAnd fuck that dough cause I spent that fast\nNo money management, fucking with cash\nThese days man just say fuck the past\nNowadays days my whips better than your dads\nMy old headmaster used to have a Jag\nNow that I'm buying and selling old whips\nI got one of them parked up on the path\nTell the headmaster my S-Lines faster\nAnd I'm still going on wicked and bad\nExpel me are you having a laugh?\nEveryone knows the recession is bad\nYou might as well go re-mortgage your gaff\nOr downgrade, now that I'm paid\nI'll put the mortgage dipper on that\nI'll pay the mortgage\nYo', fuck the headmaster and the everyone I beat up\nCause it's your fault that I'm on this path\nIt's your fault that I seen man get stabbed\nIt's your fault I nearly got shot in the back\nIt's also your fault that I'm on a track\nAnd I made way more money in the trap\nI'm Bugzy Malone, going on cold\nNow they say I put Manny on the map\nI put Manny on the mapYou might also like20Embed"

If that's... if it goes just over sixty percent of the mark of,  'That could be at Chip', and you're in the Premier League, 'cause it goes right down to conference (mmm). Let's not- let's not get it twisted in this rap thing; I'll be at your neck, rudeboy!\n\n[Producer Tag: Bugzy Malone]\nMh, hold tight Zdot on production\n\n[Verse 1: Bugzy Malone]\nI got a phone call from Jammer\n'Cause Chip wants to know if it's beef or music\nAnd Chip don't want no trouble\nChip definitely doesn't wanna see me when I lose it\nAlright Jammer, come, let's do this\nI grab Chip in a headlock and use him\nI'm from a little town called Manchester\nI'm about to do this million views 'ting\nCheck my Fire in the Booth, it's moving\nChipmunks Fire in the Booth was borin'\nI set fire to the building\nChip made everybody in the building start snoring\nIt's meant to grime, he's talking pop politics\nLike any of that's important\nI think Chip might've missed his callin'\nHe could've been a teacher with all that talking\nWait, maybe he's falling, into depression, but that's just me\nHow many of your chains are in one piece?\nOr did they all get popped off?\nDon't talk about shows in my town\nLike your lickle show can't get locked off\nI turn into the devil, take off the door\nThen I let two-two shots off\nPap! Pap!\n[Chorus: Bugzy Malone]\nIf you, you\nYou, you\nWanna come against I, I\nI, I\nThese bullets will make man run for their lives\nNow your career's on the line\nAnd you wanna take a shot at mine\n'Cause you heard that I was the guy\n\n[Verse 2: Bugzy Malone]\nHe gets bottled so much\nThat he's grown some shit on the back of his head\nBut don't watch that, I'll finish my drink\nI'll put the glass down and slap him instead\nAs he was dissing me for shotting off zed's\nMy phone was ringing, and this is on my life\nI put the phone to my head and heard\n\"Didn't you know that Chipmunks in debt for a hundred grand?\"\nI just dropped my phone and shouted, \"Jesus Christ\"\nNow I know why he's the MJ of grime\nEverybody knows the story behind\nMichael Jackson before he died\nThe Pepper Riddim was dead\n'Cause you spat thirty-two bars, told twenty-two lies\nAll my lyrics are on my Mum's life\nI thought you was the grime scene saviour\nWhat's with all this funky behaviour?\nI heard Chip's new EP, and it was about as grime as Maverick Sabre\nI'm not feeling Chip-Diddy-Chip\nI'll leave Chip-Diddy with a high fade\n'Cause my lyrics are all sharp like a razor\nYou sound like you've been touched with a taser\nAnyhow you see Chippy in the distance\nClimbing over the fence like Vega\nWith that shit on the back of his head\nHe looks like Sonic the Hedgehog from Sega\nI thought you was signed to a major\nI don't think your label's paid ya'\nBecause I heard you spent your money\nHiring Chris Brown out for the day 'cause\nBut you still didn't even chart proper\nGoing on like your a chart topper\nChris Brown was dancing on a bus\nThen he hit Ri-Ri with a show-stopper\nBut you're not in the history book to be honest\nNo one could give a fuck\nEverybody knows Alvin is a punk\nHe's was like Chris Brown featuring Chipmunk\nYou might also like[Chorus: Bugzy Malone]\nIf you, you\nYou, you\nWanna come against I, I\nI, I\nThese bullets will make man run for their lives\nNow your career's on the line\nAnd you wanna take a shot at mine\n'Cause you heard that I was the guy, (0161)\n\n[Verse 3: Bugzy Malone]\nChipmunk's a coconut that I'll open up\nSo you can see the white in the middle\nBright white like cocaine, drag him in a ginnel\nAnd kick him about like piggy in the middle\nAnd now I got Chippy in my neck\nI guess this means that I'm in your league\nBut you've got five-hundred-thousand followers\nMe? I'm only on about fifteen\nYou got buried off Tinie, buried off Narstie\nBut nope, you wanna come at me\nBut don't watch nuttin', I'll end your career Chip\nNow man are shouting \"R.I.P.\"\nSomebody hashtag 'RIPChip'\n'Cause I'm in a totally different league\nI'll tear more than a ligament in your knee\nYou're looking at grime 2015\nI think Chipmunk might just run outta bars\nBugz can't run outta bars\nYou was a pop star last week\nNow it looks like Chipmunk has run outta stars\nDon't do Pop and then come back\nAnd act like it's the Return of the Mack\nAnd please don't mention the School of Grime\n'Cause even the beat on that was trap\nWhen it comes down to the School of Grime\nI am the headmaster of my time\nAnybody comes at me, they'll get expelled\nAnd sent home at dinner time\nHow can a chipmunk fight with a lion?\nChipmunk will get eaten alive\nI'll feed him to the lions, you can go and ask Solo 45\n[Chorus: Bugzy Malone]\nIf you, you\nYou, you\nWanna come against I, I\nI, I\nThese bullets will make man run for their lives\nNow your career's on the line\nAnd you wanna take a shot at mine\nCause you heard that I was the guy, (0161)\nIf you, you\nYou, you\nWanna come against I, I\nI, I\nThese bullets will make man run for their lives\nNow your career's on the line\nAnd you wanna take a shot at mine\nCause you heard that I was the guy, (0161)\n\n[Outro: Bugzy Malone]\nEy yo' Chip\nHow ya' gonna get ya' career ended like that, punk?\nSince when the fuck did a pop star send for a real grime MC?\nEspecially one from Manchester\nI don't know what's going on in the pop premiership\nBut this is the grime premiership, bro\nAnd I'm relegating you, fam\nTrust me, there's a new kid on the block\nManny on the map, trust me, daddy\nAbout you tried to diss me\nCall me a prick and all that\nAnd then try phone me on some friendly manipulation 'ting\nAnd then you wanna tweet, talking about reasoning\nEverybody knows beef needs seasoning, shit (0161)\nYou gon' make all the sweet chilli riddims you want, my brudda, huh?\nThat was dead\nThe whole 'ting was dead\nChipmunk is dead, his career is dead\nTrust me, it's a Bugzy Malone 'ting, 0161\nManny on the fucking map\n(0161)36Embed"

'cause I see the bigger picture\nEvery one of us kings\nWe could live on the street\nAnd make it a castle\nFuck what they call us\nThey can keep throwing out orders\nIn fact bring cameras and record us\nWe've been fighting for survival\nAnd you're gonna learn what war does\nWhy did they call it an army?\nThat's 'cause it's filled with soldiers\nThere's a war going on outside and it's life\nYou can keep the revolvers\n[Chorus: JP Cooper]\nIf you wanna know something 'bout me\nThe blood in my veins is full of northern grit\nI got that northern soul, man I got bags of it\nWe're far from ordinary people\nAnd if you wanna know something 'bout us\nThe hearts in our chest are full of northern love\nAnd even when we're broke, we'll always have enough\nWe're far from ordinary people\nWe're far from ordinary\n\n[Verse 2: Bugzy Malone]\nOkay, what did they expect?\nThey expect us to fail this test\nThey think 'cause we're broke and we're not blessed\nLike we're gonna watch our parents stress\nNo chance...\nAnd more time our parents are broken up anyway, there's no romance\nAnd the car's been sold\nAnd that's 'cause there's no keeping up with their finance\nWhat do they want us to do?\nSkip down the road to the job centre and just hold hands?\nIt's not easy out here, depression's a killer\nEspecially when you've got no plans\nSo much pain on a daily basis\nWould you not grab the painkiller with both hands?\nIt's a shame the painkiller's weed and liquor\nStrong enough to wipe out the whole gang\nIf I'm being brutally honest\nI don't condone it, but I understand the stealing and the violence\nYeah man run when they hear the sirens\n\"No comment\"\nLeave the room in silence\nThat's the same boy who's mum got treated bad in the job centre on Friday\nDad don't care so he lacks the guidance\nIt's a shame that the streets are evil\nBut thats just where we grown up\nAnd not everything was legal\nBut that's where we learnt to be tough\nMost people grind to a halt\nLike a car with no petrol or no diesel\nBut we keep it moving round here\n'Cause we're far from ordinary people\nYou might also like[Chorus: JP Cooper]\nIf you wanna know something 'bout me\nThe blood in my veins is full of northern grit\nI got that northern soul, man I got bags of it\nWe're far from ordinary people\nAnd if you wanna know something 'bout us\nThe hearts in our chest are full of northern love\nAnd even when we're broke, we'll always have enough\nWe're far from ordinary people\n\n[Bridge: JP Cooper]\nI see the raindrops falling again\nWe look up to greet the heavens\nWho cares if we had harsh beginnings\nWe know congruence\n\n[Chorus: JP Cooper]\nIf you wanna know something 'bout me\nThe blood in my veins is full of northern grit\nI got that northern soul, man I got bags of it\nWe're far from ordinary people\nAnd if you wanna know something 'bout us\nThe hearts in our chest are full of northern love\nAnd even when we're broke, we'll always have enough\nWe're far from ordinary people\n[Outro]\nWe're far from ordinary people...2Embed"

   "lyrics": "SPITFIRE Lyrics[Verse 1: Bugzy Malone]\nWhen I was about ten\nEnded up robbing all of my school friends\nFor the Pokemon cards, finger skateboards\nSix years before I ever went pen\nFive years before I got expelled\nFour years before I got kicked out\nThree years before I was a good student\nTwo years before I got missed out of Santa Claus\nHe didn't wanna bring me nuttin'\n'Cause I was underprivileged\nThat means now I walk with a complex\nAnd trust me I try my best to get rid of this\nI want more money than you consider rich\nI was on the roads and I didn't give a shit\n'Cause I was taking phones and taking bikes\nAnd I swear my niggas was killin' it\n[Verse 2: Bugzy Malone]\nChillin' with D, blazing weed\nSat back watching reservoir dogs\nUsed to sell white and B for a boss\nUntil I licked off like twenty-five Oz\nThat's when I realised we was a gold mine\nWas only eleven more z's in a box\nAnd I was seventeen, fresh outta jail\nRollin' with a pedal bike and a dog\nI p-p-p-paint pictures with words\nAnd I paint them like Vincent Van Gogh\nStill spending money from '08\nAnd I've still not taken the bands off\nStill got access to the sawn-off\nStill got more brothers than Warner\nStill on this music 'ting and I'm still in the gym\nAnd I can still hold my corner\n\n[Verse 3: Bugzy Malone]\nTrust me you don't wanna start drama\nCah the roadside gets hot like a sauna\nAnd that's why man wear body armour\n'Cause it gets political like Obama\nI was on the bus two years ago\nWith one-hundred-thousand views on flush, pressure\nLong black raincoat for the bad weather\nBut don't watch that 'cause things get better\nNow I got the S-Line everything leather\nDoes nought-to-sixty in five-point-seven\nBugzy Malone's on a different level\nCah' even the whip turns into the devil\nIt's madness, tryna escape from the ghetto\nThat literally is hip hop heavy metal\nI hear that revenge is sweet\nBut I just hope that it tastes like amaretto\nYou might also like[Verse 4: Bugzy Malone]\n'Cause I'm about to get back\nAnybody that thought I was gonna do another stretch in jail\nIf success tastes like Coca-Cola\nThen I'll have a large Coke and Amaretto\nOn the rocks or fresh out the bottle\nYou'll never catch me drowning my sorrows\nUntil I got told Dane was in a coma\nI took more shots than Miguel Cotto\nThe left side of my chest went hollow\nI went out like the mask of Zorro\nI made the sky turn red\nRan in the crib\nAnd then turned into the devil\nPsht, get over here, whoopie\nFinish him like subzero\nOut the window, into the garden\nOver the fence and straight through the ginnel\n\n[Verse 5: Bugzy Malone]\nYou're soft in the middle like Bueno\nAnd talk too much like you're on Jay Leno\nYou've been to the gym for the day\nAnd you're already walking around like you're henno\nI'm Bugzy Malone, the wickedest 'ting since Liberace learned to play the piano\nI make a jet black boy turn yellow\nI'm tryna make more notes than Celo\n[Outro: Bugzy Malone]\nIt's Bugzy Malone again\nAnd I'm home again\nSo I'm zoning in\nI didn't think I'd see microphone again\nThe booth thrown me out\nSo I kicked off the door like I owned the house\nEverybody in the room got thrown about\nHulk smash, flip the couch\nTied the producer to the chair\nAnd that's why I got brand new music out22Embed"

(0161)\nHang tight SnoWman on production (Somebody hashtag 'RIPChip'\nCause I'm in a totally different league\nI'll tear more than a ligament in your knee)\nYou know how it goes (You're looking at grime 2015)\n[Verse 1]\nSeems like I'm achieving my goals\nGot retweeted by the MOBO's\nAnd I felt like David Beckham back in '96\nAfter scoring seventeen goals\nI made a Fire in the Booth and the Relegation Riddim\nAnd Manchester united\nSo now I say \"0161, Manny on the map\"\nAnd the mandem get excited\nNow it's all hectic in man's city\nLet's get down to the nitty gritty\nI came from the bottom into the premiership\nNow I'm notorious like Biggie\nNow it's all glorious, I'm ready\nAnd I'm so curious already\n'Cause right now life feels like I'm watching the Fast and Furious on telly\nI'm not used to the limelight, I rhyme tight\nBut I usually drive round on a dark night with a grime beat on\nNow I'm getting played on Radio 1Xtra, the best station that I've been on\nSat looking at my Mum\nWe went from sitting on a visit in jail\nTo looking in the rear view mirror\nInto the past and waving goodbye to the slum\n\n[Chorus]\nI am the grime scene saviour\nNot you, not you, not you\nI put my town on the radar\nNot you, not you, not you\nI'm the Chipmunk relegator\nThat's who, that's who, that's who\nAnd I heard that you're in danger\nIs that true? Is that true?\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nYo, you know when you're in too deep\nAnd you're losing sleep and not by choice?\nReceiving over a thousand tweets\n'Cause you've got the streets making noise\nMy name got big so fast\nYou would've thought my name was taking 'roids\nI got a bigger hype than when Manny Pacquiao decided he was gonna fight Floyd\nInstagram couldn't picture this\nMy opinion pissed off a hypocrite\nCharlie Sloth told 'em I was an animal\nThen a Chipmunk got ripped to bits\nI'm in a different league, it's so mad, I've got\n10 missed calls off my distance Dad, I've got\nSo many text messages off ex-girlfriends\nTryna draw me in like I'm a sketch pad, but I\nRemember the days I was in the gutter\nNobody gave me bread and butter\nSo now I say \"Where do you know me from?\nGet off my line, did I stutter?\nGet off my line, did I stutter?\nGet off my line, did I stutter?\nGet off my, line, line, line\nGet off my line, did I stutter?\"\n\n[Chorus]\nI am the grime scene saviour\nNot you, not you, not you\nI put my town on the radar\nNot you, not you, not you\nI'm the Chipmunk relegator\nThat's who, that's who, that's who\nAnd I heard that you're in danger\nIs that true? Is that true?\n[Verse 3]\nMy Fire in the Booth left yours\nAnd the Relegation Riddim of course\nI told them watch how they war with me\nAnd now it's like Chip-Diddy-Chip can't talk\nCan't even mention my name in war\nWhy? 'Cause the sweet chilli riddim was poor\nI think there's something they need to know about Chipmunk\nLet me tell 'em in a metaphor\nA little boy got a knock on the door\nHad to go police station of course\nCould've gone no comment, probably taken a charge\nBut this boy talked to the law\nAnd now that little boy is on course\nThe next pop star that wants to do grime\nBut his friend never got bailed from court\nAnd now he's locked up for a long time\nAny minute now they're gonna open the door\nAnd that little boy's gonna run and hide\n'Cause I heard that it is all out war\nIn his own grease, he's gonna fry\nHe's just like Devilman\nAnd no one likes a snitch so how can them man reply?\nI am the headmaster of my time\nYou'll get banned from spitting on grime\n\n[Chorus]\nI am the grime scene saviour\nNot you, not you, not you\nI put my town on the radar\nNot you, not you, not you\nI'm the Chipmunk relegator\nThat's who, that's who, that's who\nAnd I heard that you're in danger\nIs that true? Is that true?\nI am the grime scene saviour\nNot you, not you, not you\nI put my town on the radar\nNot you, not you, not you\nI'm the Chipmunk relegator\nThat's who, that's who, that's who\nI heard Skepta disowned ya'\nIs that true? Is that true?10Embed"

Watch this\n\n[Verse 1]\nIt's not physical pain, it's psychological pain\nEmotionally scarred so bad I was wearing a mask like Bane\nNot an actual mask, a psychological mask\nWhat do you find that mad?\nWhat about a kid that had to find his dad\nOnly to find that he didn't like him back\nNot physical pain, psychological pain\nI seen it from the beginning, I was there on the wedding day\nThe happiest kid in the world when I'd seen the smile on my mum's face\nI thought it was real\nI heard the vows, I threw the confetti\nLittle did I know it was fake\nNot physical pain, it's psychological pain\nEverything I loved in life just went up in flames\nI went from cold to freezing\nI watched the family break into pieces\nI thought that adults could iron out creases\nI thought family was cousins and nephews and nieces, not arguments and police\nNot physical pain, it's psychological pain\nAnd if you look closely enough you can see the pain in my face\nAll the confusion, too many lies\nIt's all an illusion, nobody tries to understand\nYou get kicked to the kerb and nobody says one word\n[Chorus]\nI'm a bad boy and I know why\nI get mad 'cause I said I won't cry\nAnd the pain runs deeper than the blue sea, but the tears they will never run dry\nYou're looking at a bad boy, bad, bad boy\nBad boy, bad, bad boy\nBad boy, bad, bad boy\nBad boy, bad, bad boy\nI'm a bad boy and I know why\nI get mad 'cause I said I won't cry\nAnd the pain runs deeper than the blue sea, but the tears they will never run dry\nYou're looking at a bad boy, bad, bad boy\nBad boy, bad, bad boy\nBad boy, bad, bad boy\nBad boy, bad, bad boy\n\n[Verse 2]\nYa'\nIt's not physical pain, it's psychological pain\nAnd I'd be lying to myself if I said I didn't miss Dane\nI watched him come from Jamaica\nSat with him playing on Sega\nSat thinking about paper\nMe and him were the same age, and it just meant that we were rebellious by nature\nPhysical pain, psychological pain\nThey sent him back, while I was sat locked up in a cage\nI hit the roadside pissed, told him over the phone \"wait there I'll bring him home\"\nTried to make money in time, but it was too late\nIt's not physical pain, it's psychological pain\nThey told me he fell from a bus and got bleeding on the brain\nI prayed to The Lord, bring him back if he could live normal\nHe was in a coma, no-one's immortal\nTurns out his condition was awful, it must have been fate\nIt's not physical pain, it's psychological pain\nAnd if the storm don't pass then I'm going to dance in the rain\n'Cause no matter what I'm a soldier, the world gets colder and colder\nEvery day that I get older I realise that life's way to short to play games\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI'm a bad boy and I know why\nI get mad 'cause I said I won't cry\nAnd the pain runs deeper than the blue sea, but the tears they will never run dry\nYou're looking at a bad boy, bad, bad boy\nBad boy, bad, bad boy\nBad boy, bad, bad boy\nBad boy, bad, bad boy\nI'm a bad boy and I know why\nI get mad 'cause I said I won't cry\nAnd the pain runs deeper than the blue sea, but the tears they will never run dry\nYou're looking at a bad boy, bad, bad boy\nBad boy, bad, bad boy\nBad boy, bad, bad boy\nBad boy, bad, bad boy\n\n[Outro]\nBad boy\nBad boy, bad, bad boy\nBad boy, bad, bad boy\nBad boy, bad, bad boy\nBad boy, bad, bad boy7Embed"

Bison and Ken\nAnd I've been a bad boy ever since then\nNever been a hero like Clark Kent\nAnd now I'm like Scarface without the scar\nAnd I'm like bane, without the mask\nI'm like the joker without the cards\nAnd I don't care if I look bad\nI want a Porsche GT that's matte black\nSo I can drive through the hood like Batman\nUsed to have a nine in the backpack\nSo I could run through the door like a cat flap\nAnd now I've got a hoodie matching my snapback\nAnd they know my voice when I'm on track\nA hitman couldn't kill a beat like me my brudda' if he signed that contract\nTrust no one we're not on the same wave\nI shut man down then I vacate\nIf he sees the whip then he might hate\n'Cause my nigga we're not the same age\nPlus I've been avoiding the twelve gauge\nI heard man put a hole in his rib cage\nOpened the door, let off the ting\nAnd then vacate the estate\nAnd then vacated the estate\nGunchester's never been a nice place\nFrom a place where man can't dictate\nWhether man are gonna live to an old age\nSo I stay fresh like colgate\nAnd I don't watch no face when I make change\nI've been on the roads and it ain't great\nI've seen big reputations deflate\nYeah, he had a Maserati on a ten plate\nUntil he went out on a rampage\nTook two shots to the chest plate\nNow he's lying six feet deep in a fresh grave\nNow that's that life, that's that life\nThat's that life that I explained\nR.I.P. to my dead mates\nMay the fallen soldiers set pace\nThe stereotype's gone way too deep\nFor the mandem to work for a set wage\nSo we stay out 'til it's dead late\nAnd make friends with a nigga that knows pain\nThat way you don't have to explain\nWhen you lose it and misbehave\nInto the devil I turn, sky turns red\nThen I pull out the flip blade\nFlick, flick\nPull out the flip blade\nFlick, flick, flick\nPull out the flip blade\nI'm the wickedest ting since Brotha' lynch hung\nAnd the music's sickmade\nBut I never sold my mixtape\nI made money on the road, you live straight\nYour music's like wet weed\nBut when it dried out it lost weight\nTrus' me\nYou might also like[Verse 2: Buzy Malone]\nNow I'm Bugzy Malone\n'Cause the name Bugz got played out, on the roads\nKicked off doors\nShut down raves\nBroken jaws\nBroken glass\nBig boy mash\nMade man sleep and I made man stash\nMade man creep and I made mad cash\nWith the big boy heat when I ran in the gaff\nStill got a beard, still got a moustache\nStill know how to get the road gassed\nStill on this music 'ting and I'm still in the gym, and I can still go on like Mad Max\nTrust me you don't wanna start no trash\n'Cause the roadside gets hot like Baghdad\nS'why the mandem walk with a strap\n'Cause it gets diplomatical fast\nYo' it gets diplomatical fast\nI've been on the road since manny got gassed\nStill, make my ex-girlfriend wanna ask\nIs he gone cool, or is he still mad\nI don't know, tell her it's mad\nStill been knocking out man for my mates\nKnocked on the door, threw a left hook\nAnd I left teeth all over the place\nThat's no joke, tell them, bro\nMan left teeth all over the place\nJust the other day, that's no-\nMan left teeth all over the place\nThen I seen police all over the place\nIn '06, nearly got an eight\nBoy got stabbed, but it wasn't me\nAnd I've still not got over the case\n[Outro: Bugzy Malone]\nNow I have dreams, that I get chased\nAnd I just can't get over the gate\nFreddie Krueger couldn't come in my nightmare\n'Cause I'll leave cuts all over his face\nFrom Gunchester: home of the brave\nGunchester: home of the brave\nGunchester: home of the brave\nGunchester: home of the brave7Embed"

(Ah)\nNow I'm supposed to feel weak?\nFor some reason though I feel like a Wolverine\nLike I smashed the side of the car up with my physique and left a big boy dent in the concrete\nThey put me in the newspapers and magazines\nYou better recognise a legend when you catch a sneak peak\nIt's not the first time I shed blood out on the street\nBut the way they taped it off, it was like a murder scene, ah\nYou might also like[Outro]\nFucking Bugzy Malone\n2020\nThe fucking resurrection\nYeah\nAh5Embed"

    "plain": "First played on Radio 1Xtra on the 18th May 2017 at 8pm, Through The Night is Bugzy\u2019s second known track on his EP, King of the North, after Aggy Wid It. He links up with other artists DJ Luck and MC Neat also on the track, collaberating, something Bugzy rarely does.\n\nHis EP King of The North was avalible by pre-order at midnight of the same evening, within 24 hours of release, it was number 1 on the pre-order charts.\n\nThe track itself is Bugzy throwing his weight around in the grime scene, with a few subtle mentions and shots to other artists and London in general, being the main hub of grime, with a few subtle mentions of Stormzy, Chip and the elders in the grime scene.\n\nWithin a day, coninsidentally Stormzy has tweeted this, not annoyed of course.\nhttps://twitter.com/Stormzy1/status/865584454772768769\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRNoLOHiUo0\n\nThe music video is also shot in London, in very coninsidental locations, such as the Penthouse he is in at the start of the music video, is literally right next to Chip\u2019s Penthouse, seen commonly on his snapchat story, a North-Thames side complex with a nice view of the Shard. Bugzy also films in the same location going over London Thames Bridges like Stormzy in Big for Your Boots off his recent album to this track \u201cGang Signs and Prayer\u201d. The album is a common theme in this song.\n\nThe remaining music video is shot in Brixton -\n Electric Nightclub, a place Bugzy has performed recently to this track on the 20th of January 2017.

He links up with other artists DJ Luck and MC Neat also on the track, collaberating, something Bugzy rarely does.\n\nHis EP King of The North was avalible by pre-order at midnight of the same evening, within 24 hours of release, it was number 1 on the pre-order charts.\n\nThe track itself is Bugzy throwing his weight around in the grime scene, with a few subtle mentions and shots to other artists and London in general, being the main hub of grime, with a few subtle mentions of Stormzy, Chip and the elders in the grime scene.\n\nWithin a day, coninsidentally Stormzy has tweeted this, not annoyed of course.\nhttps://twitter.com/Stormzy1/status/865584454772768769\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRNoLOHiUo0\n\nThe music video is also shot in London, in very coninsidental locations, such as the Penthouse he is in at the start of the music video, is literally right next to Chip\u2019s Penthouse, seen commonly on his snapchat story, a North-Thames side complex with a nice view of the Shard. Bugzy also films in the same location going over London Thames Bridges like Stormzy in Big for Your Boots off his recent album to this track \u201cGang Signs and Prayer\u201d. The album is a common theme in this song.\n\nThe remaining music video is shot in Brixton -\n Electric Nightclub, a place Bugzy has performed recently to this track on the 20th of January 2017. Coninsidentally again, Chip performed on exactly the same stage on the 29th April 2017, likely around the time this music video was shot."

(Life!)\nHow did he come so far? (Life!)\nHow did he go from selling drugs, signing on\nTo becoming a star? (Oh life!)\nI'm like the Leonardo Dicaprio forget about trophy's\nI just want to know have you ever counted\nFive-hundred-thousand-pounds out in twenty-pound notes? No?\nBecause I've never been standard\nYou can get lost out here and get stranded\nAnybody coming to the North tryna fuck with the King\nOn a boat or ship and get anchored\nAll hands on deck because I don't take kindly to idol threats\nThese MC's are some overnight MC's\nThat's why they want me dead\nYou might also like[Hook: DJ Luck]\nWith a little bit 'a luck\n'Dey might make it through the night\nWith a little bit 'a luck\n'Dey might make it through the night\nWith a little bit 'a luck\n'Dey might make it through the night\nWith a little bit 'a luck\n'Dey might make it through the night\nTa-na-ne, ta-na-ne, ta-na-ne, ta-na-na-te boy\nTa-na-ne, ta-na-ne, ta-na-ne, ta-na-na-te boy\nTa-na-ne, ta-na-ne, ta-na-ne, ta-na-na-te boy\nTa-na-ne, ta-na-ne, ta-na-ne, ta-na-na-te boy\nWith a little bit of love\n'Dey might make it through the night\n\n[Verse 3: Bugzy Malone]\nMore money, more life, more, more money, more life\nMore money, more life more, more money, more life\nMore money, more life more, more money, more life\nMore money, more life,\nI don't fuck with none of these guys\nIt's groggy season Rucka's after Rucka's\nMost of these MC's are just muppets\nDem man say I'm just lucky\nLike said I don't know bar-for-bar, I'm just mucky\nI'll make a dark-skinned MC crumble\nJust like a double chocolate chip cookie\nI'm King Kong\nI'll make a light-skinned MC sound like a newborn puppy\nThey can team up they can round the whole scene up\nBut it's not going to make a difference on G-Dot\nDem man are pissed off because they've got shows\nBut right now they're performing for peanuts\nWhat kind of a MC looks at the DJ\nReaches out for the decks to get wheel ups\nYou're not a MC you're just a copycat it won't last\n[Hook: DJ Luck]\nWith a little bit 'a luck\n'Dey might make it through the night\nWith a little bit 'a luck\n'Dey might make it through the night\nWith a little bit 'a luck\n'Dey might make it through the night\nWith a little bit 'a luck\n'Dey might make it through the night\nTa-na-ne, ta-na-ne, ta-na-ne, ta-na-na-te boy\nTa-na-ne, ta-na-ne, ta-na-ne, ta-na-na-te boy\nTa-na-ne, ta-na-ne, ta-na-ne, ta-na-na-te boy\nTa-na-ne, ta-na-ne, ta-na-ne, ta-na-na-te boy\nWith a little bit of love\n'Dey might make it through the night4Embed"

   "lyrics": "Fire In The Booth Part 2 Lyrics[Verse 1: Bugzy Malone]\nMe, I just got one question, who's doing it better?\nI have to write to the judge through a letter\n'Cause a victim told that I sick vendetta\n'Cause his lips needed stitches\nA precedent report\nAnd I'm famous now, there's no bending the law\nSo I could get community service\nAnd worst case, I could get back behind the door\nBack to jail\nAnd it's mad 'cause I can still remember the smell\nThe atmosphere, and the lightning\nThe way that your mind would get carried away in a cell\nThe silence speaks louder than the bell\nThat's been ringing for the past fifteen minutes\nAnd we don't know if the kid's hurting himself\n'Cause the officers don't care\nThey never asked how did he get here\nHe never had a dad, mum tried her best, but that didn't matter because the rent was so dear\nThat she couldn't cope sober\nSo she drank spirits and not beer\nI'm talking about legless drunk\nThen his stepdad hit him with a wreckless punch\nAnd his mum turned her back\nAnd that's when the care inside the kid was done\nI'm talking about me, get it?\nBeing a rolemodel taking its toll, but I got this\nI was only twelve years old when I got hit\nReally I hope my stepdad'll watch this\nBecause I was only a kid\nAnd I loved him more than anybody else\nBut he fucked it\nHow can you beat up somebody's mum\nI just want him dead and I don\u2019t even want justice\nMy little sister, yeah, that's his daughter\nBetween me and her is a little bit awkward\nBecause I remember when she said she hit my mum that night\nJust to cover her father\nI could forgive, but I cannot forget\nNo hard feelings have been hard\nBut as long as you do, well nothing else matters\nConsidering where we started\nConsidering this time last year I was stood here\nTalking about Bury New Road\nI was starving\nI had drug money\nBut I didn't know about getting money from touring\nAnd that's why I gotta thank Charlie\nBecause he showed me the ropes\nAnd then left me to stand on my own two feet\nLike Christopher Reeve before his spinal stopped working\nAnd I've focused on evolution like Darwin\nThe minute 2016 kicked in, I stopped drinking\nI don't wanna do parties\nI hear my mans saying its curtains\nSo when I see him I'll hurt him\nIt's not fame when you tossing and turning\nAnd watch money when your money\nWhen you can't stop mummy from hurting\nAnd the row's not dead, because the minutes still burstin'\nAn ID means that they see him in person\nThe bally was working and now the witnesses are uncertain\nI believe in God; I don't trust the religion\nI don't get how Mary can be a virgin\nStill I just got one question, somebody tell me\nWho's doing it better?\nWho got these MCs dissing each other?\nThe brand new EP is out now\nNow I went I took a mugshot and used it as the front cover\nSomebody twisted it up and created a story, to make me look like a robber\nI thought I'd sit back and watch the commotion\nAnd that's why I didn't say nothing on twitter\nI'm out\n[Pre-Verse 2: Bugzy Malone]\nBugzy Malone\nBBC 1Xtra, Fire in the Booth\n\n[Verse 2: Bugzy Malone]\nIt's been a year and I see things clear\nNow I been training and I don't feel no fear\nNow they ask if I'm living down here\nNow I tell them \"No\" I still get about Manny in my Berghaus\nI told them to walk with me the whole tour sold out\nWhat a turn-up\nStill got to the girl's house\nAnd I know man with ringers all ready to burn out\nI hope I don't need them\nThis year I don't wanna risk my freedom\nBecause I know that I got shows in Sweden\nAnd I've been booked all over festival seasons\nI got Parklife, then I got Wireless, then I got Glastonbury\nMan tried it with me last year and got fed to the tigers\n'0161 spreading like a virus\n2016 has got them pulling off stunts like a BMX biker\nNot everybody's gonna like it\nSo they'll bring an article out just to try and rewind ya'\nThey said I went running in a Jewelers\nDo they think I'm stupid?\nI got music videos, looking like movies\nLooking at one of the best to ever do this\nWhy would I start chasing guys?\nFor a couple of watches with ice\nSo I sat watching haters celebrating\nBugzy Malone, \"Facing Time\", but that's the EP\nAnd the same people sharing the Artwork daily\nYou can't see me on CCTV\nBadding enough now I got clothes in JD\nIt's nothing friendly this year\nMe, I'm trying to save for a Bentley this year\nSo I started my own label, it Ill-Gotten Records\nAnd that's gonna pay me this year\nMore time man are gonna hate me this year\nBut the same man are gonna rate me next year\n'Cause I created a blueprint from out of town\nTo show what it takes to get here\nI don't do blaze, and I don't like drinking\nI spend twenty-four hours in a days thinking\nI watched all the big guys shrinking\nAnd the Bugzy Malone business line keeps ringing\nIt's like I got a '3310 with links in\nBare new lyrics and flows\nIt's like I'm sat there bagging up O's\nAnd the haze is stinking, the line is [..ringing..]\nPut it this way, when I see set\nMan are gonna have to do a lot of explaining\nI'm one of the best, I got the game changing\nAsk them man who made it, start raining\nWho made the grime scene entertaining?\nI don't know, I'm just saying\nI disappeared for a week, and man thought it was peak\nAnd put out a tweet, well I call this the David Blaine\nWhy? 'Cause the EP's banging and them man know it\nI put manny on the map last year\nAnd the '01 to the '61 keeps growing\n'Dem man are Chameleons\nAnd right now their true colours have started showing\nThey want me out of the game, I'm not going\nTell them go write me another poem\nI'm Bugzy Malone, eugh!\nI know certain man want me to allow them\nWhy? 'Cause I got an email in my inbox\nAsking me if I wanna do joint album\nBut I thought my man thought I was a dickhead\nAnd I never would've been nothing without him\nPeople lie; numbers don't\nRight now the numbers got them counting\nWords mean 'noting if you don't do well\nYou're not popping if your shit don't sell\nYou promoted my new EP too\n\"Congratulations you played yourself\"\n\"Congratulations you played yourself\"\n\"Congratulations you played yourself\"\nMad 'ting, I'm like Batman to my whole town\nIt's mad, I bought a brand new RS3\nBecause it's small and fast\nTook it to the body shop, told them, \"I need it all in black\"\nThe first day I drove it\nA van pulled out on me and we just crashed\nI was sat there, surrounded by smoke and air bags\nI jumped out and the van was flipped with its window smashed\nThe car was a write off so I just kept it moving rags\nBecause I had a photoshoot, with Supply and Demand\nWatch the collab but, watch this\nRoad is road, and lyrical beef is lyrical beef\nAnd they made an article to make me look like I'm a thief\nAnd then got my songs taken off iTunes\nSee, me, I won't sleep\nUntil I find out which MC has tried sabotaging me\nAnd I'm out\nYou might also like[Outro: Bugzy Malone & Charlie Sloth]\nBugzy Malone! '0161\nYeah! That means Manchester's in the building\nAnd we're here to stay\n2016! Groggy season\nNotin' friendly right now\nBugzy Malone!4Embed"
