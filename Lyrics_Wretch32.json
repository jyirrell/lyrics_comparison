  "plain": "Jermaine Scott, better known by his stage name Wretch 32, is a Tottenham rapper who has gone from an underground grime MC to a household name in the UK rap scene. Originally a member of supergroup The Movement alongside Ghetts, Scorcher, Mercston and Devlin, he released a slew of free mixtapes from as early as 2006. His debut album, Wretchrospective, was released in 2008.\n\nIn 2011, Wretch found mainstream success with the songs \u201cTraktor\u201d, \u201cUnorthodox\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Go\u201d, the latter of which topped the UK Singles Chart. His second album, Black and White (2011), went gold in the UK and even prompted his label to re-release Wretchrospective in 2012.\n\nIn 2013, Wretch broke the silence after a brief hiatus from solo content. He released \u201cBlackout\u201d and \u201cDoing OK\u201d, billed as the first two singles from his third album. A further two new songs touted as album tracks, \u201cBlur\u201d and \u201c24 Hours\u201d, featured on the FIFA 13 and 14 soundtracks respectively. However, the album\u2019s extensive arena tour got cancelled and its release was pushed back.\n\nAmidst countless features and remixes for other artists over the years, Wretch has explained the album\u2019s delay. Another non-album single, \u201cAlright with Me\u201d, was released at the end of 2015, following 2014\u2019s hit \u201c6 Words\u201d. A collaborative mixtape alongside Avelino, entitled Young Fire, Old Flame, dropped in December 2015, accompanied by numerous music videos.\n\nWretch\u2019s third album, Growing Over Life, was released on 2 September 2016 after four years of recording. \u201cAntwi\u201d, \u201cLiberation\u201d, \u201cAll a Dream\u201d, \u201cI.O.U\u201d and \u201cOpen Conversation & Mark Duggan\u201d were all released throughout the year in the run-up to the album.\n\nIn 2017, Wretch released his fourth studio album, FR32 (pronounced free-two). It was preceded by the singles \u201cWhistle\u201d, \u201cTell Me\u201d and \u201cHis & Hers (Perspectives)\u201d. He also made his fifth Fire in the Booth appearance later in the year, surrounded by red balloons to promote the album release."

    "plain": "The comeback single after a year with no news.\nApparently Wretch was intending this song for album number four but once he heard the result, he had to get it out there so it\u2019ll be on Growing Over Life.\n\nThe song features backing vocals from session singers Teni Tinks and Vicky Tola.\n\n\n\n\u201cListening to Beenie Man, Bounty Killer and all those guys when I was growing up, I heard them guys rapping and singing and they can\u2019t really sing, but it still sounds good because it\u2019s in-tune. I wouldn\u2019t class them as singers. like I would Whitney Houston or someone, but they have the ability to do that because it\u2019s in their range and I knew it was in my ability because I can sing along with them, but I can\u2019t sing. I always had in my head, \u2018I\u2019m gonna make a record where there are no rap verses.\u2019 And that\u2019s what \u20186 Words\u2019 is. It\u2019s not like everyday rap and I\u2019d say that Gary Barlow and Chris Martin inspired it because, in the studio, all I was thinking was that I needed to write a better song than what they would write.\u201d"

I wouldn\u2019t class them as singers. like I would Whitney Houston or someone, but they have the ability to do that because it\u2019s in their range and I knew it was in my ability because I can sing along with them, but I can\u2019t sing. I always had in my head, \u2018I\u2019m gonna make a record where there are no rap verses.\u2019 And that\u2019s what \u20186 Words\u2019 is. It\u2019s not like everyday rap and I\u2019d say that Gary Barlow and Chris Martin inspired it because, in the studio, all I was thinking was that I needed to write a better song than what they would write.\u201d"

I've been frankly detouring\nI left my soul in every city, it's sad but it's honest\nThe amount of morning-after pills, I should have an endorsement\nFirst year I really tapped into my audience\nYou won't be asked to pay respect if you cannot afford it\nSee, if the fruits of my labour's to rap every morning\nI should Frank Ocean the label and channel my orange\nI hope I'm one step away from that place there\nThey told us that Craig would only have seven days there\nHe came back, sky is just a limit we place there\nLightning struck twice, guess it really can rain here, I rate that\nWe're all signed, yeah I love the water splashing waves fam\nUsed to want to be a ninja turtle when I was eight fam\nWe were young shellers eating pizzas in estates man\nI'm still here in a tight circle, that's the same band\nI pray I never see the day you're switching sides on me\nWe've always been adjacent, you could never slide off me\nNow I'm living righteous, only fish in my body\nImma do or die properly, I got human rights on me\nWhen your child dropped, it was like another child from me\nAnd if it pops off, then we'll be side-by-side, obvy\nI wish you all the best but that's never life's story\nCos if Whitney was the moral, how would you define Bobby?\nThink about it, and if you can't live without it\nDon't let it go, take it home and build bricks around it\nJust try set it in stone, then stick around it\nAny time you feel it in your soul, that's the gift about it\nDisallow it or the control to make you drink about it\nI fell in the zone and woke up in a liquor fountain\nThat's a tight space, a dark hole can have a thing about it\nBet you didn't know that going in could be a killer outing\nI've had conversations with the best newcomers\nAnd the worse old runners and the jewels they got were free\nCos I can only give you me\nThey don't tell you how to live your dream without the sleep\nHow on the weekend you're the man but it gets lonely in the week\nNo surrender, no retreat, some family on your tree now\nCan only see your branch when they used to hear your leaves\nUsed to share your feast\nThen no-one was hungry soon as the GOAT became the sheep\nThat's why I am pescetarian, it was sink or swim in the aquarium\nEither break the glass or you share with them\nShots at me but I can only give what I receive\nThere's gun powder on my clothes now, washing my machine\nI dealt with the matter when that was all that mattered\nYou ate all the pies while I was sharing out the platter\nAnd Judas on the table is like a Buddhist with a hammer\nBringing peace with a piece, you want the passage or the passa?\nMake your bed, you lie in it\nI sleep so comfy, I hope I die in it\nSo if you wanna scar, lemme know, I'm Lion King\nI can make a movie, live forever and die in it\nThey're praying on my downfall\nSo I took off in the spring and touched down in the fall\nI hope I gave you what you wanted\nRunning from police, I was wanted\nMy future wasn't promised, that changed when my neighbours were the wanted\nNot engaged but she busy doing for the D challenge\nHow 'bout we make a challenge for our children to be challenged?\nOvercome the odds of black people getting married\nProbably tell me suck my mother cos, you don't know where your dad is\nAnd I feel it for you, just be the man of the house\nDon't let the streets abhor you\nBlood of a king, heart of a slave, you should keep it royal\nDon't let the streets employ you\nCos that's a slippery slope, and it's either grease or oil\nUntil you hit the soil, did you reap what you sow soon as the reaper's got you?\nI've been there, got the T-Shirt, rest in peace to moral\nI know it seems immoral, but degrees are optional\nSo we don't read, we follow\nSo don't tell me stay woke when I ain't slept in three days\nSay I sold my soul, I want my check from E-bay\nIf you love the rapper, then respect the DJ\nCos without one, you couldn't mic-check the replay\nIf I was a player man, I'd probably take the knee\nI'm no longer a player soon I'd probably take the knee\nI'm shooting through the hoop, I'm trying to make a baby free\nAlready got a major team, I'm trying to make a major league\nSo would you rather mud on your jeans or blood on the leaves?\nI've seen my mother cry when her little brother deceased\nI'm family orientated, I have to uncle my niece\nThis type of outgoing, you never underachieve\nStill felt like the gift when there was nothing under the tree\nMy poor mother told us that nothing's coming for free\nNow the show's sold out, everybody's coming for free\nAnd I can see your heart, and it's barely touching your sleeve\nDon't tell me about circumference, that ain't circumference to me\nI'm from the type of circle with (censored) up then we leave\nAnd this squared circle ain't WWE\nKeep acting like you're raw, you'll get smacked down in the streets\nAll I see is fuckery every time on the news\nThe hurricane really just took their lives and their roof\nTheir whole life, all of their family under one roof\nGod made the wind blow and it really took 'em to you\nI guess he must be missing an angel, we got a few\nThat shooter out in Vegas, he really gambled with youth\nTo even out the odds, should let me snap him in two\nAnd fight fire with electric and shock him out of his shoes\nCharlie, that's me!\nI'll get you hit before it hits\nDon't ask me about the balloons because I was it before It\nAnd if they don't say I'm nice then they didn't play it thriceYou might also like4Embed"

(Yeah)\nMan, you're on the telly.\"\n\"And how can you moan about rollin' around?\"\n\"Ain't you got a Bentley?\" (Shh)\nLet me show you where I get lost\nWhen I get picked up then I jet off\nAnd I get picked up when I get off\nStraight to the hotel like \"Get washed\nDo interviews and press shots,\"\nThen I hit the venue get my \"Wretch\" on\nFeelin' hungry lookin' at the restaurant\nBut we gotta rush for our flight, gotta get gone\n\n[Interlude 1]\nYou're the man, you're the man, you're the man, you're the man\n\n[Verse 2]\nThen I get picked up when I get off\nAnd I do a few photos with some new press\nTrying to sound alive when I feel like death\nDon't know what I need more, food or rest?\nBein' rude ain't Wretch, so I've gotta take a picture\nI'm with y'all when I ain't even with y'all\nSaid \"Follow me back\", my only problem with that\nIs that my battery's flat, there's no Twitter\nNo Twitter, no BB\nIn the back of the car, the new ET\nI wanna phone home, believe me\nBut I can hear in your tone that you need me\nIt's ironic that I spoke to the sun\nBefore I spoke to my son\nLooks like I'm gettin' scared of familiar voices\nAnd that's somethin' that I'm really annoyed with\nIt's like the things that seem to mean most\nJust end up one of my a million choices\nSo how do I how avoid this?\nWithout hearing your pointers?\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI said \u201cNo, I\u2019m tired\u201d, they say \u201cYes you can\"\nPush me to the fire, they say that you\u2019re the man\nI said \"No I\u2019m tired\u201d, they say \u201cYes you can\"\nPush me to the fire, they say that you\u2019re the man\n\n[Interlude 2]\nYou're the man, you're the man, you're the man, you're the man, you're the man\nYo Wretch, wake Up. Wake up, we're here\n\n[Verse 3]\nThat sleep in the car felt like a few hours\nIt was just a few minutes (Woo)\nAnd I reach for my Red Bull to get some power\nBut I forgot it was finished\nWent straight into makeup to get that powder (Yeah)\nFor that fake star image\nNow go look alive, then they throw me my mic\nAnd I'ma straight up kill it\nLadies say I got gorgeous cheeks\nSmile for the pictures before I leave\nMy head's been spinning since 4 or 3\nSo after the flash I see four of me\nThe whole team's spirits like a cord I see\nJust find the first place and it's soon on me\nOne more PA, then we all can sleep\nThat 24 hours was an awesome week\n[Bridge]\n(Oh-eeh-oh-eeh-oh-eeh-oh)\nThat 24 hours was an awesome week\n(Oh-eeh-oh-eeh-oh-eeh-oh)\nThat 24 hours was an awesome week\n\n[Outro]\nWelcome to the darkest alley\nWhere happiness seems so saddenin'\nHow are you standing?\nWelcome to the darkest alley\nHappiness seems so saddenin'\nHow are you standing?\nThe hunger's gonna feed you action12Embed"

However, the verse closes where he tells her that he\u2019ll always be there to support her.\n\nIn the second part, Wretch uses a lighter tone behind his original voice, which lets us know that her is talking.\n\nHer primarily talks about the lack of respect that he is giving her. The lack of effort cleaning the house or caring for the house. Additionally, she mentions is that he cheated on her, even though he had a family at home.

The lack of effort cleaning the house or caring for the house. Additionally, she mentions is that he cheated on her, even though he had a family at home. However, she closes the verse explaining that she will always be there to support him."

Imagine if you gave me something\nProbably just say your favourite word: say nothing\nAnd don\u2019t try and lie because I know that it\u2019s true\nIt was one of your friends fucking telling on you\nPlus the fact, I could fucking smell it on you\nYou treat me like I\u2019d never do better than you\nIf you left me on the floor, that\u2019s a step up from you\nI don\u2019t know why love made me settle for you\nAt the end of the day you know that you\u2019re my nigga\nSo at the end of the night I've always got you dinner\nHad to state a few things even though you\u2019ll say I\u2019m bitter\nIt\u2019s just my point of view, although you probably beg to differ\n[Chorus: Wretch 32]\nHis and her point of view\nIn this world where we grew\nThere\u2019s his and her point of view\nHis and her point of view\nIn this world where we grew\nThere\u2019s his and her point of view\nHis and her point of view\nIn this world where we grew\nThere\u2019s his and her point of view\nHis and her point of view\nIn this world where we grew\nThere\u2019s his and her point of view2Embed"

Antwi, a music lawyer, founded Full & Bless Management and Levels Entertainment, and helped Wretch get recognised by the industry through a partnership with Ministry of Sound.

'Cause I don't want another chase\n'Cause I'm tired and there's no one to relate\nNor can nobody relate\nMy grandmother was a great\nI had to put her in a grave, now my shoulder still aches\nI had to carry her away\nI'm still carrying the pain\nFuck marrying the fame\nThis is for my family to gain\nAnd the young me's carrying my name\n[Outro: Bobii Lewis]\nPray for me, yeah\nPray for me, yeah\nPray for me, yeahYou might also like5Embed"

Then you've never seen Jermaine\nIn his white-gold chain back in the day, just give me space\nYeah\nThough I might have took a Galaxy\nI never had a pound\nCouldn't afford a Ford so I had to run around\nWhat the fuck's an allergy?\nAll my niggas nuts\nWe weren't allowed in the youth club\nBefore we hit the clubs\nThey said enough was enough\nSo we had to give 'em more\nWhen you see sides, I just wanna know you're sure\nAre you sure?\nOr do you sympathise?\nYou grew up on Kinder Surprise\nI had licks and rice and had to drink my pride\nOne-on-one since six or five\nLost my marbles, looking down the drain\nTryna find 'em, I couldn't find 'em\n(Look a little closer to home, you might find 'em)\nI might find 'em?\nFuck that, I've got my skateboard\nI've got my rucksack, I've got my 8 balls\nI've got two sticks and I ain't playing pool\nI know who's who, I'm from the same school\nAnd it's hard knocks, where it makes you\nOr it breaks you, I didn't snap in half\nI just snapped in class\nIt's a miracle I didn't catch that charge\nAin't got time to waste\nNight time, that's like my time of day\nWhen you're 32 shade of grey\nIn this concrete jungle, you've gotta pave a way\nJust don't let 'em take your Jane\n(Can't take you, baby)\nI start playing Jason when they get adjacent\nYou know how that movie goes\nClick-clack, bang-bang on my foes, 2Pac taught me that\nBiggie Smalls taught me swag\nGot my Versace shirt, put my car in reverse\nI was hypnotised with Medusa in my lenses\nNow I'm Medusa to my exes\nDon't look at me, don't look at me\nUnless you've got the whole booking fee\nI used to have a hole in my jeans\nHoles in my tee\nNow I buy outfits for the whole of my team\nYou couldn't short on the block I live\nMoving Bobby Brown, that was just my prerogative\nJust my prerogative\nDriving cars with no indicators\nI took a right turn with no indication\nThe only stimulation was ipi-dipi-dation\nHow many of my niggas I'll be seeing in the station?\nI'm getting fed up\n'Member they put the cuffs on me\nFelt like I couldn't even stand up or breathe\nBrother Mark never made it to custody\nI see his kids now and again\nI give them every cent that I've got up in my pocket\nBut it isn't enough\nCause when he saw me at the lights, he said give me your number\nGot the same school shirt, now I'm wearing this jumper\nSaying RIP\nJust know you R-I me\nEvery verse from your coffin and I'm not stopping\nSick of money often, see Kamani often, see Shenaia often\nSee the pressures we had, tryna take it off them\nTurned the hangman rope into straight white-gold\nCuh we rose from the dungeon\nZeros to the hundreds\nAnd they can write books on us where we come from\nThat's why we're heroes on our junction\nYou might also like[Hook: Varren Wade]\nGrown on me\nCan't sing but I wrote you a song, that's grown on me\nAnd my treasures have grown on me\nAware of the responsibilities, grown on me\nAnd when I wear a suit and tie, it looks grown on me\nI ain't changed, I'm just a new old me\nOr did you know me?\nGrown on me\n\n(Music so gorgeous, got you feeling flawless)\n(Music so gorgeous, got you feeling flawless)\n(Mu-mu-music so gorgeous, got you feeling flawless)\n(Music so gorgeous, got you feeling flawless)\n(Music so gorgeous, got-got you feeling flawless)\n\n\"Mark Duggan\"\n[Break: Stafford Scott]\nWho are the murderers?\nPolice are the murderers!\nNo justice? No peace!\nNo justice? No peace!\nNo justice? No peace!\nWe don't do this because we want to do this\nWe don't do this because we read in a book that it's a good thing to do\nWe do this because for generations, they've been killing black people all over the country\nPoor and working class people all over the country\nAnd always getting away with it\n[Bridge: Bobii Lewis]\nI heard it's all been love\nCupid, draw back your bow\nWe need to follow that arrow\nWhile I'm on my feet\nIf they shoot me down, would you riot for me?\nRiot for me\nWe need to follow that arrow\nAs long as we believe\nTwo tears falling like the innocent\nSpirits in the wind\nWhat's respect if they expect silence?\nOh\nSirens when we disrespect\nSirens when we disrespect\nWhat's respect if they expect silence?\nWe hear sirens when we disrespect, yeah\n\n[Verse 2: Avelino]\nI just lost my mind\nI just lost my mind\nIs it me or am I scared of the cops outside?\nThere's cops outside\nThere's an I in team but I'm on my side, I guess\nRoses are red\nViolets for the violence\nYeah\n\n[Outro: Bobii Lewis]\nWhat's respect if they expect silence?\nWe hear sirens when we disrespect3Embed"

I can breathe and have a flow\nOur love's concrete\nWe should leave it set in stone\nYeah and when ever I'm in doubt\nYou forever calm me down\nAnd sometimes I'm a dummy and I know I would of crashed if you never was around\n[Hook: Josh Kumra]\nSo don't go, don't leave\nPlease stay, with me\nYou are, the only thing, I need\nTo get by, get by\n\n[Verse 2: Wretch 32]\nI spend a little change on you\nBut you always give it back\nCos' I know you ain't here for the money\nYou just wanna see me be the man\nSo I earnt my respect like a true gentleman\nAll rumours were capital Irrelevant\nWe should get three two emblems\nI give my life to you that's a street settlement\nYeah, I'm feeling ever so emotional\nCause I never had nothing when approaching you\nSitting with a straight face on a poker move\nThat's why a song like this has been over due\nDue over time\nTime over\nLove drunk, you and I would die sober\nI'm in this for forever and a day\nThat's why wherever I go, they've got to put you on a plane\n\n[Hook: Josh Kumra]\nYou might also like[Verse 3: Wretch 32]\nSee I swear, I ain't ever seen a sky so clear\nTogether we're gonna make history\nWhy would you wanna be elsewhere?\nSee I swear, I ain't ever seen a sky so clear\nTogether we're gonna make history\nWhy would you wanna be else where?\n\n[Bridge: Josh Kumra & Wretch 32]\nDon't go leave me now\nDon't go leave me\n(Stay right here and turn my darks day in to light years -- I'mma shine)\nDon't go leave me now\nDon't go leave me\n(Loosing you is one of my fears\nBut I ain't selfish I shear, if I have to)\n\n[Hook: Josh Kumra]\nSo don't go, don't leave\nPlease stay, with me\nYou are, the only thing, I need\nTo get by, get by\n\n[Hook]6Embed"

   "lyrics": "Fire in the Booth\u00a0Part 3 LyricsNot another nigga, nah, not another nigga\nDropped on the front line with a cop behind the trigger\nThrow your spirit in the sky, probably drop you down and snigger\nThat\u2019s why every drop of Henny\u2019s like a shot inside my liver\nCertain I\u2019m the difference, but they\u2019ll probably beg to differ\nTryna spit my thousand words before they crop me out the picture\nThat a selfie, self-less, I\u2019m self-raising\nI had no P, outta breath, I kept chasing\nCouldn\u2019t go sleep, no rest, this world\u2019s waiting on my Rolly\nHell yeah, you tell Satan that I pray to the Lord, pray to the most high\nPenny for my thoughts, you\u2019ll get a monkey for most lines\nI turn words into numbers\nThat made work for my brothers\nFrom a kid in the bits to Columbus\nNow the world\u2019s my circumference\nMy little man\u2019s talking \u2018bout bands, I just hope that my son\u2019s in the Mumford\u2019s\nHope he don\u2019t lose his way, the apple don\u2019t fall too far\nThe designer\u2019s the future in every way\nAnd I\u2019m better than Shakespeare, and I ain\u2019t writing any plays\nNor am I writing to get played, it\u2019s just my right to get the plays\nI was underground \u2018cause it\u2019s alright to take the train\nBut if you was God\u2019s son would you be hiding in the shade?\nI\u2019m Rolling in the Deep, setting Fire to the Rain\nAnd it\u2019s Written in the Stars in some Newton Oil Paint\nWhen I craft my art, I favour Banksy\nMan I\u2019m Rich with life, I\u2019m on my Antwi\nYou see I\u2019ll hold my weight until my hands bleed\nOnly got my word and my bars, swear on my canteen\nMan if I punch lines, I\u2019ll show you hand speed\nI will do a Strickland Banks before I Plan B\nNigga I go realer, you chimpanzee\nMonkey I don\u2019t fancy dress, I dress fancy\nYou see I once was lonely to start off\nNot now, these companies, I\u2019m a part of\nVerset Vodka, that\u2019s that drink we own all of\nI\u2019ll show you the flick of the wrist, because my arm\u2019s strong\nStrength no weakness, doing press-ups like the kids\nNow I\u2019m trying to get my kids a head start\nTo get them set, on their marks\nOn this marathon of life I\u2019m Gebrselassie, a son of Selassie I\nMo Farah, my brother, told me keep up my stride\nMore Stephen Lawrence than Boris, running to stay alive\nTry, crop me out picture like I\u2019m Dame\nBut I\u2019m just another Jigga with some glitter in my chain\nEight hundred on my frames, half a milli on my plates\nOnly keep it 100 if I\u2019m running with Usain\nBut I keep it 300 when I\u2019m running with my mates\nOn some Louis Farrakhan, we ain\u2019t running from a race\nI grew up in a maze, where I saw cats chasing their tails\nDogs selling to cats, man killing their dogs\nThe lost things that they found, the found thing that there God\nFighting over ground, but to none of us it belongs\nAnd the cons outweigh the pros, but the pros can wear your odds\nAnd turn coke into powder, that\u2019s just connecting the dots\nMan, now are you tempted to shot?\nTempted to touch, attempted to murder\nThey tried to kill me before, nothing against me shall prosper\nMoney on my head, I'll have to Kevin my Costner\nComing for my bread, I\u2019ll turn your muscles to lobster\nWifey playing nurse, and guess who\u2019s playing the doctor?\nDr. King, Dr. Dre, man I sold pharmaceuticals, I did the doctor way\nMan I\u2019m trying to meet Jay before he dashes the Roc away\nCause Bishop show up prison, man, I\u2019m only a block away\nRich said \u201cWho wakes up and really wants to come second?\u201d\nCounting on my brother, got me counting all my blessings\nEver lost someone who found you with intentions on bringing something out of you to turn you to a legend?\nWhen I hear the news I had to park up on the curb\nI was on the phone to [Twin?], and we didn\u2019t even say a word\nI\u2019m so used to pain, but there\u2019s a difference when it hurts\nCause when they took away your body man it multiple your worth, in my eyes\nI had tears in my eyes, Dunn's River Fallin\u2019, man I couldn\u2019t even dry cry\nSpend time alone, see I just had to define life\nThe good die young, so your calling was primetime\nLast time I came I competed with the world\nNow this time I\u2019m here I\u2019m competing with myself\nDon\u2019t put me in a bracket with no one bro\nI got so many bullet points, bruv, that I overload\nAdd me to the magic you might give him an overdose\nWhile I swim into a ocean, rock the boat, cause I overflow\nI\u2019m so used to splashing, man I\u2019m so used to splashing\nYoung Fire\u2019s on the rise, and he\u2019s just waiting for the baton\nBut I told him that he might have race me till I\u2019m [paton?]\nGot my masters in English, so I may resort to Latin\nBy the time you hear time, I\u2019ll be past gear six\nAnd if they ain\u2019t dead already, they just had a near miss\nI put the \u201cfear\u201d in fearless\nPussy, get a smear test\nAnd if it gets political, call me Tony Blair Witch\nWhy did we vote \u201cLeave?\u201d Why did we vote \u201cLeave?\u201d\nThe government\u2019s sending kids to sleep with no dreams\nTheir trying to tick a box, you would have thought they sold weed\nEverybody\u2019s high, no wonder why the future\u2019s codeine\nCodeine crazy, every dabbin\u2019, having codeine babies\nHaving March Madness, cause their Rolly\u2019s 18\nBut I\u2019m \u201cMr. Free B.A. Baracus,\u201d A-Team\nWith the top down, got the whip looking Page 3\nDo you sympathise with me?\nStarted From the Bottom, why the keep reminding me?\nThere\u2019s no similarities with you and I\nIf I gotta die to be the best, would you do or die with me?\nI grew on the late Biggie hypnotizing me\nAm I grime? Am I rap? Why they keep dividing me?\n\u2014\nWhy they keep dividing me?\nEverybody goes deep and can SCUBA dive, yeah\nThey can all flow 'til they gotta synchronise with me\nI made my own lane\u2014can you see the drive in me?\nI\u2019m banned from every club\u2014can you see the Nile in me?\nThere\u2019s hatred in my love\u2014can you see the irony?\nIt\u2019s flamin' in my lungs\u2014I should take this mic with me\nCause I\u2019m James Brown when he shot up the label\nI\u2019m Scarface with a key of coke on the table\nSinging a song of praise, but I don\u2019t need no appraisal\nCause I\u2019m Pharrell Grindin\u2019, just tryna Pusha my ends\nSpirit of DMX, singing Flesh of My Flesh\nI\u2019m Nas before Kelis and old school K. West\u2014new school K. West\nStill they all ain\u2019t Wretch\n\u2018Cause if they don\u2019t call me classic, gotta call me blessed\nBut I still do the sign of the cross, before I leave out\nYou can nail me to the cross\u2014if you need now\nIf you keep calling me blood, and we don\u2019t bleed out, and let that shit run like rivers\u2014you\u2019re in de-nial\nMost Ws in the booth\u2014I\u2019m in the league now\nThis is called \"Fire in the Wretch\"\u20143-2 style\nYou might also likeCharlie change the name!\n\nAnd if they don\u2019t say I\u2019m nice, then they didn\u2019t play it twice\nYou know why?\n\nThat\u2019s cause 365 I stay Growing Over Life\nAh, yeah\n\nSupport Wretch 32\u2019s upcoming studio album \u201cGrowing Over Life,\u201d which drops September 2nd, 2016!1Embed"

Words\n\nI nearly broke my back trying to hold you up, I'm back trying to hold you up again\nWe're running with the fact that it's only love, if that can be only love we're 'f'd\nRanieri turned water into wine right in front of our eyes from the bench\nNow we've got him on the spot taking shots and no-one's allowed to run to his defence. Mad ting\nSee I'm growing my hair, just trying to grow again\nAnother top 5, just let me go again\nSee I grow over life, but I ain't going yet\nBut Eve's still trying to bite the apple out of my throat again\nAnd he still think that he's the man around my zones again\nAnd he don't see he's Peter Pan, he's out growing them\nAnd she sees him and gets gassed and that's petroleum\nAnd them two there light the match and that's the both of them\nAnd Tito probably wished that he was Mike when controlling them\nBut Mike probably wishes he was alive and in the zone again\nR Kelly wished that he could fly and bring soul again\nAll these ribbons in the sky, I'm taking note of them\nCoz' Stevie probably wished that he had sight and could hold the lens\nMake the revolution televised in the Odeon\nOne time I was with Mercedes in my old BM\nI just had to take her for a ride just to roll again\nIronic how I used to sell gear just to own a Benz\nNow them want me on the top gear just to show for them\nFunny how I'm like an older for my older friends\nDigging in my minds like a mine when I show them gems\nThey think that to buss it up you got to own a skeng\nSometimes you can buss it up with your own events\nIt's winter now but I don't snuggle up with the hoes and them\nI'm just trying to flash, snap, dash then dispose of them\nGet away with murder like the cops that patrol the ends\nTrying to grow my money like my locks, keep it shoulder length\nI'm just trying to take it to the top till I'm over them\nOverseas having aubergines with the locals them\nNowadays I'm coming hard hitting, that's a bonus then\nHard written, I am Charles Dickens with a colder pen\nIf selling out a whole tour means I've sold it then\nI'm in my element, I'm so solid, I am sodium\nFans might want another verse but these rappers don't want another hearse, I wouldn't wish it on them either\nI'm this sick carrying these germs so I just might sanitize a verse now they're calling me a diva\nA writer ain't as talented on earth that can rock my nation with these words coz I might have to give him ether\nYou're trying to be banging on your curb, I'm trying to be Pharrell hanging with them nerds, trying to channel through the speaker\nI've seen money come, I've seen money go\nYou're turning up, I'm turning ghost\nHoly flow, you can feel the spirit through the words he wrote\nTrying to make a drink from a drink, that's a worthy toast\nMastermind despite of what you think, I've been certi though\nBut I don't move like a yout coz I'm 30 yo\nYou can smell a 7 figure nigga when he wears cologne\nBut sometimes you've got to watch how you word it though\nI'm dealing with those people that don't speak to other niggas\nTell Mr. Belvedere he might not sell another litre\nHaving drink wars they're getting beaten by my liquor\nAnd to think we thought there might not be another Jigga\nI'm one song away from Immortal\nSo even if I die, I might come back through the portal\nYou know that you're a lord if you get god to record you\nSo until you earn your stamp just address me as Corporal\nAnd that's why I took your girl to heaven and back, we didn't stay long\nThe way she worked on me I may never quit my day job\nI was with a chick from LA in Lagos\nI love a flirtaholic, have her drinking until the taste's gone\nOld school, I used to let it bang from my tape don\nBussin' shots through my neighbours wall, it was game on\nYou can say the neighbours know my name, that's a Trey Song\nDog eat dog world and I ain't talking dalmatians\nWoof woof, hush puppy shoes and my good looks\nSchool of hard knocks we graduated to a hoodlum\nAnd we didn't way when we ever heard 'boom boom'\nThe real rise and fall and I ain't talking about no Suge book\nDeath row still exists\nI know niggas that will die before they ever recoup that shit\nStill we coup this whip\nYou really want that notorious film? You best record like 2Pac did\n[Outro]\n(Daily Duppy. 32 edition. This is gonna be the last one. It's my birthday and shit. I had to take this one from my brother Ghetts, it was yours but it's mine now. God bless. Love, life and prosperity)You might also like2Embed"

We used to fight like Cat and Dog\nFlickin' through the catalogue before I ever had a song but now you're in my catalogue\nYeah, you take me higher than any E with a capital\nYou know that I'm a G so I'ma always show you gratitude\nFirst is, second mum, how am I gonna thank you all?\nWhen mum wasn't here you'd be shouting in my ear\nCanon jumped into gear, it was like you had a manual\nRunning out of words, this ain't a chapter, it's a verse\nI'll be free by your side until they trap me in a hearse\nI owe you everything I earn, everything is hers\nI'll write an I.O.U cause what's the man without the words?\n[Chorus: Emeli Sand\u00e9]\nA, E, I.O.U, I vow forever\nA, E, I.O.U, yes I remember\nA, E, I.O.U, my best forever\nA, E, I.O.U\n\n[Verse 3: Wretch 32]\nFirst mum, second god\nI pray we always get along\nYou're raising my princess, hope she reaches your echelon\nI didn't know a queen had to be a king too\nYou worked every hour and you cooked and cleaned too\nThat little bit of flour made a three-course meal\nThat's why your hotels have always got a sea view\nYou were the first to give me breath, the first to help me with my steps, even the first to call me Wretch and now they call me 32\nAny time I'm on the stage, man I feel your presence\nIf I only had a word I'd give you half the letters\nAnd if I ever done time you'd do half the sentence\nLucky I never went, when I got my ass arrested\nCause you always kept me in when I was running the streets\nAnd any time I came late you was gunning for me\nI'm uncomfortable until you living comfortably\nAnd I will never take a penny because I love you for free\n\n[Chorus: Emeli Sand\u00e9]\nA, E, I.O.U, I vow forever\nA, E, I.O.U, yes I remember\nA, E, I.O.U, my best forever\nA, E, I.O.U\nYou might also like[Bridge: Emeli Sand\u00e9 & Wretch 32]\nThe way, you loved me more than I did love myself\nThe one that I can trust like no one else\nYou picked me up and carried me from hell\nAnd I just want you to know that\n\n[Chorus: Emeli Sand\u00e9 & Wretch 32]\nA, E, I.O.U, I vow forever\nA, E, I.O.U, yes I remember\nA, E, I.O.U, my best forever\nA, E, I.O.U\n\n[Outro: Emeli Sand\u00e9 & Wretch 32]\nA, E, I.O.U, I vow forever\nA, E, I.O.U, yes I remember\nA, E, I.O.U, my best forever\nA, E, I.O.UEmbed"
