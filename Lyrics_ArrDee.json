  "plain": "Riley Davies, professionally known as ArrDee, (Born September 17 2002) is an artist hailing from Brighton, England and is quickly rising to be one of England\u2019s most exciting emerging artists. His name derives from the pronunciation of his initials \u2013 RD.\n\nOriginally wowing fans through freestyles on social media sites such as Instagram, one of the first appearances from illusive Brighton artist came in the form of a BL@CKBOX Freestyle in 2019 which gained a steady attraction.\n\nArrDee gave his fans his first track on January 24th, 2021, releasing \u201cCheeky Bars.\u201d The song provided ArrDee a platform to reach new heights, the music video garnering over 3 million views since its release. It wouldn\u2019t be long until the he released his next project, as ArrDee would drop \u201c6am In Brighton\u201d in March 2021.\n\nThe Brighton native would drop a verse on Russ Millions & Tion Wayne\u2019s \u201cBody (Remix),\u201d which went viral on TikTok. He would jump into the studio shortly after with Fumez The Engineer, releasing a highly anticipated freestyle for his Plugged In series, just 2 weeks later.\n\nCapitalising off his newfound attention, ArrDee dropped his fourth single \u201cOliver Twist\u201d in June 2021, which went viral on TikTok as expected. The song is his biggest hit to date, debuting at #7 on UK\u2019s Official Charts."

I just wanted some more, Oliver Twist\n(Wanted some more)\nHah\n\n[Chorus]\nI just wanted some more, Oliver Twist (More?)\nThink I didn't take risks to get to this 'sitch?\nDon't take the piss (Nah)\nI've been scummy, I admit\nI did what I did, but I deserve this\nThat's why the bottle got popped at six (And th\u0435n?)\nAnd I'll holla one thot by the ev\u0435ning\nI used to think I'm just dreaming (What for?)\nI just wanted some more, Oliver Twist (More?)\nThink I didn't take risks to get to this 'sitch?\nDon't take the piss (Don't do it)\nI've been scummy, I admit\nI did what I did, but I deserve this\nThat's why the bottle got popped at six (Then what?)\nAnd I'll holla one thot by the evening\nI used to think I'm just dreaming\n[Verse 1]\nNow I'm up and my ex-girl's all in her feelings (Fuck off)\nIt's too late, darlin', 'cause\nThis ship is sailed away from your reaching\nAin't one for preaching\nBut I've come a long way from all the rules I was breaching\nSome lessons, there ain't no teaching (Nah)\nGotta do it and learn for yourself, I never did want no help\nBiggz just told me he's worrying 'bout my health (My health)\n'Cause I've had four pints\nAnd three shots of rum\nAnd it's half-past twelve (Don't watch that)\nIn the afternoon, not the morning\nTold him it's evening time somewhere else\nIn the world (Somewhere, bruv)\nPlus, how you think I've made it so lit? (Huh)\nI mean, besides the fact I'm the shit\n\n[Chorus]\nI just wanted some more, Oliver Twist (More?)\nThink I didn't take risks to get to this 'sitch?\nDon't take the piss (Don't do it)\nI've been scummy, I admit\nI did what I did, but I deserve this (Sure)\nThat's why the bottle got popped at six (Say what?)\nAnd I'll holla one thot by the evening\nI used to think I'm just dreaming (What for?)\nI just wanted some more, Oliver Twist (Oliver Twist)\nThink I didn't take risks to get to this 'sitch?\nDon't take the piss (Don't do it)\nI've been scummy, I admit\nI did what I did, but I deserve this\nThat's why the bottle got popped at six (Fuck that)\nAnd I'll holla one thot by the evening\nI used to think I'm just dreaming\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nNow dreaming's the way I be schemin'\nManifested, now I'm succeedin'\nI've read the secret, I know the meaning\nYou want more? You don't get there pleadin', bruv\nFight for your cause, kicking and screamin' (Trust me)\n'Cause I come from the shore, but the poor part\nAll you see is crackheads fiendin', man's smokin' weed and\nAll the guys from dem sides\nComin' down OT, dealin' (Them man there)\nI push her buttons, I pull strings\nI've got her hooked and due to be reelin'\nI ain't faking a thing but\nYou should take what I say with a pinch of salt (Trust me)\n'Cause I find shit funny\nBut that's 'cause you laugh in times of no hope\nThat's how I learned to cope (That's how I learned, bruv)\n\n[Chorus]\nI just wanted some more, Oliver Twist (More?)\nThink I didn't take risks to get to this 'sitch?\nDon't take the piss (Don't do it bruv)\nI've been scummy, I admit\nI did what I did, but I deserve this (Sure)\nThat's why the bottle got popped at six (Then what?)\nAnd I'll holla one thot by the evening (Ayy, ayy, ayy)\nI used to think I'm just dreaming (Ayy)\nI just wanted some more, Oliver Twist (Oliver Twist)\nThink I didn't take risks to get to this 'sitch?\nDon't take the piss (Don't do it)\nI've been scummy, I admit\nI did what I did, but I deserve this\nThat's why the bottle got popped at six (Fuck that)\nAnd I'll holla one thot by the evening\nI used to think I'm just dreaming\nI just wanted some more, Oliver Twist (More?)\n[Outro]\nThink I didn't take risks to get to this 'sitch?\nDon't take the piss\nI've been scummy, I admit\nI did what I did, but I deserve this\nThat's why the bottle got popped at when?\nThat's why the bottle got-\nAh, ah, ah, ah\nI just wanted some, Oliver Twist3Embed"

    "plain": "\u201cFlowers (Say My Name)\u201d is the latest single from up-and-coming Brighton MC ArrDee and follows his July 2021 single \u201cJiggy (Whiz)\u201d. The single was originally teased on TikTok on the 14th of October 2021. The official video of the single also features ArrDee\u2019s rumoured girlfriend, Instagram model Angelyssia.\n\nThe single is inspired by Sweet Female Attitude\u2019s iconic April 2000\u2019s UK Garage classic \u201cFlowers\u201d, in which it samples, as well as Destiny\u2019s Child\u2019s iconic 1999 single \u201cSay My Name\u201d.\n\nJuxtaposing the latter songs, ArrDee strays away from a conventional love song and navigates through topics such as the trust issues that come with a relationship and his bachelor lifestyle."

The single was originally teased on TikTok on the 14th of October 2021. The official video of the single also features ArrDee\u2019s rumoured girlfriend, Instagram model Angelyssia.\n\nThe single is inspired by Sweet Female Attitude\u2019s iconic April 2000\u2019s UK Garage classic \u201cFlowers\u201d, in which it samples, as well as Destiny\u2019s Child\u2019s iconic 1999 single \u201cSay My Name\u201d.\n\nJuxtaposing the latter songs, ArrDee strays away from a conventional love song and navigates through topics such as the trust issues that come with a relationship and his bachelor lifestyle."

I cum and I go, literally\nThey all show love on the road, and I got bad girls all tryna get pics with me\nIf I step in the club, then they sit with me (Come)\nIt\u2019s a blessing, I ain't gonna bitch, but, see\nI bet you now, they wouldn't stick with me (Facts)\nIf I didn't rock this flow\nIf I didn't pop, then blow, but I chose this\n\n[Chorus]\nIn this world, you come and you go (Go, come and you go)\nStory of my life (Life)\nI've been on my ones, on grinding\nNot gettin' by but it's all timing\nI don't mind it, it's alright (It's all good)\nHowever you cope\nWhen you live in a place so cold\nHearts get froze, I don't trust a soul\n'Cause in this world, you come and you go (Go, come and you go)\nStory of my life\nI've been on my ones, on grinding\nNot gettin' by but it's all timing\nI don't mind it, it's alright (Don't mind)\nHowever you cope\nWhen you live in a place so cold\nHearts get froze, I don't trust a soul\n'Cause in this world, you come and you go (Go)\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nI got my own but I got me first (Me)\nShout out the ones that have done me dirt (Shout out)\nI pour the pain in the verse\nBut, bruv, I've been hurt so much it don't hurt (Nah, nah)\nI bring bro 'cause he put in the work\nThey come and they go but he wouldn't dare\nFrom young, he been there, and never been scared\nHe'd kill a man before they touched my hair (My hair)\nBut most of them came and gone (Uh)\nI think that's why I'm always moving\nI never stay, I switched up the plot\nHardly even lay my head in my spot (Don't stay there)\nI'm an outside baby, but the mind that I've got\nI would never swap, I've been through a lot (Trust)\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause in this world, you come and you go\nStory of my life\nI've been on my ones, on grinding\nNot gettin' by but it's all timing\nI don't mind it, it's alright (It's fine)\nHowever you cope\nWhen you live in a place so cold\nHearts get froze, I don't trust a soul\n'Cause in this world, you come and you go (Go)\nStory of my life\nI've been on my ones, on grinding\nNot gettin' by but it's all timing\nI don't mind it, it's alright (It's alright)\nHowever you cope\nWhen you live in a place so cold\nHearts get froze, I don't trust a soul\n'Cause in this world, you come and you go (Go, come and you go)\n[Outro]\nStay with me, don't fall asleep too soon\nThe angels can wait for a momentEmbed"

   "lyrics": "Daily Duppy Lyrics[Part 1]\n\n[Intro]\n1-6-9\nAh, ah ArrDee, ArrDee\nEy, ah\n\n[Verse 1]\nThey don't wanna see you shine\n'Cause they see you shine, but don't see you grind\nI was 14 with weed and a line\nCah didn't have p but I needed a dime\nTold mandem I wouldn't leave them behind\nIf I ever get there, got the team in the ride\nThen I see set' man creep on the sly\nI don't need to remind them, I've been on their mind\nStill feeding the guys\nWhenever I can cah they've been with me from the start\nKnow how it feels when you've been on your arse\nCan't believe they're labelling me as a plant\nGot me conflicted\nCah that means in the scene all they're seeing is Ardz\nGreat, but trust me, you see what I want you to see\nAnd you never saw me on the graft\nNever saw mumzy leaving the yard cah we couldn't pay rent with a tear in her eye\nNever saw me tryna network, get a set, merk\nBut they didn't wanna see little guy\nI was in colly when I first met Bigz, we were beefing he'd argued with me all the time\n'Cause he told me that I could get big\nIn the place I was in, couldn't see to the light\nNow it's tunnel vision\nRoll to the shubz with the boys and I leave with a dozen women\nPlaced in the game, are you fuckin' kidding?\nI had to tell Karl I was gonna kill it\nHe's my manager\nI think it's because of the calibre\nWay I came in the scene, straight damager\nI'm leavin' no crumbs, I'm a scavenger\nI wasn't badding up boys, I was wrapping up\nAnyone I'm in the room with, I had to be better than them\nThat's the mindset that I work with, I started working late, never wrap up at 10\nI was sleeping in the studio way before kudos, back don't need patting from them\nThat's why I laugh when I see that they're talkin'\nAs long as they're talkin', I'm happy and blessed\n[Chorus]\nYes\nThis ain't checkers it's chess\nI can't settle and rest\nI rap better when vexed\nSo keep pissing me off and let's check how it gets\nYes, this ain't checkers it's chess\nI'm one steppin' ahead\nThey can't step in my head\nThey can't pressure and test 'cause I'm better than them\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd I don't think they like it\nYour girl scrolls through her TikTok, hears me and then get's excited\nYou ain't gotta fear me, I ain't gonna wife it\nI'm on no Johnny and piping\nYou're on some Bonnie & Clyde shit\nWe ain't the same, get left in the mist\nI was stressed in the bits\nNo cheque I could give to my mum, now I'm repping the bits, lit\nHow they gonna call me a label boy, 'cause I ain't bad and don't play with toys?\nHear bare noise 'cause I'm making noise\nAnd you're pissed off they don't wanna play your boy\nBut his flows whack so that statement's void\nIn the party, he stands in the corner, no sauce, and he can't draw none\nHow you gonna rap when you can't even talk up?\nI ain't one for the drama\nI stay smiley, bro stays behind me, and he's far from marga\nI still tell man \"nah, bruv, the dumb shit ain't worth it\"\nFrom the car to the top and the boy still ain't scratched the surface\nI was riding around in a stolen \u0160koda, pissed off that it weren't working\nFour man deep and a few beanies\nBut the steering fucked so we kept on swerving\nHe got the weed, he got the white and b, and he got the phone-line twerking\nMeanwhile, me, I'm just driving drunk with all the girls tryna try shit on\nWhat, you can't see I'm drivin' hun?\nShe said, \"I don't mind 'cause you're nice and fun\"\nIt was only right I blew in the car I was grinding from\nNow in the night, I ain't driving drunk\nI phone my guy like \"driver, come\"\nQuickly slide to a lighties drum\nI'm a sweet boy, I'll even vibe with mum when I'm into the yard\nI ain't in the for long-run, I'm in and I'm gone, bless\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nYes\nThis ain't checkers it's chess\nI can't settle and rest\nI rap better when vexed\nSo keep pissing me off and let's check how it gets\nYes, this ain't checkers it's chess\nI'm one steppin' ahead\nThey can't step in my head\nThey can't pressure and test 'cause I'm better than them\nYes\n\n[Outro]\nAh, ah, ArrDee, ArrDee\nAh, ah, ah, ArrDee, ArrDee\n1-6, 1-6\n[Part 2]\n\n[Intro]\nAh, pain\nJester made this\nThe flip side of the coin\nBigz baby\n\n[Verse]\nLook\nSo here's the part of it that ain't nobody talk about\nYou build your line and do your walk about\nAnd Liz ain't gettin' cash in, but she's catting, so she'll fork it out\nNo, I ain't cussing the hustle, I come to talk about\nThe flip side of the coin, I'm here to make a point, let's talk it out\nYou come from struggle and you're trappin' out to fill your fridge, I get it\nYou feel like it weren't your choice, you had to deal with it\nLizzy got a story too, different kinda feeling\nLiz could never really cope, so she smokin' buj, I'll take you back though\nLizzy's home was cold\nBoth her parents, Lizzy didn't know\nAn 8-year old should have her mother at the minimum to hold\nShe got bullied at her school, so as she grew, she didn't go\nShe's on the road so young, and no-one cares so no-one knows\nSmokin' skunk while her brains developing\n11 and she's always high, her pain she couldn't settle with\nVulnerable little girl, but she front it with her medicine\nThe only man she talks to is her dealer, and he meddles with her mental\nNuttin' in this world's coincidental\nThere's a reason why they call, as a trapper you ain't got a choice\nCourse they're gonna answer, if they want it, what's with all the noise?\nBut Liz ain't got one either, difference is tho, Liz ain't got a voice\nShe's scared\nHer mummy didn't love her and her daddy didn't care\nAnd her foster parents beat her and fucked her, it isn't fair\nIn that place emotions ain't gonna save you\nSo in the end it made her numb, she was done, ah\nShe's older now and Liz is more than just a stoner now\nA Rizla and a rock is all she's got, she's a lonely child\n15-years old she's got a pal, she think she knows her well\nMet her on the roads, she was homeless, she's the one that got her on it\nAnd Lizzy saw it as a favour, donny saw it as a profit\nMe, I saw it as a self fulfilling prophecy\nYou see, my city means a lot to me\nBut crackheads ain't got access to nuttin' here but the rock they need\nLizzy's mate just got a home\nThe environment ain't safe for a girl who's 18-years old, but she ain't thinkin' that\nShe saw her mate slappin' her veins and she was feelin' sad\nSo Lizzy tried it too, she's on the B now, watch her sink and that\nThe bando stinks and Lizzy's life, she's on an injured [?]\nAnd as a trapper you're focused on you, so you're just thinkin' cash\nLiz came short and don was furious, gave Liz a slap\n\"I always do you deals, you take the piss, you better bring me that!\"\nShe's sharing needles now, too afraid to call again\nIsn't eating food, don't wash herself, to live is torturing Liz\nShe started bugging on the road, all the runners took the piss\nThey're filming her on Snapchat, and Liz is crying but she's biss'ed out\nShe couldn't talk but got her quid's out\nKitty gave her more, he took the score, and then he dipped out\nLiz is on the floor, she ain't walkin' to the crib now\nThe police called her a whore and said \"there's kids about, you sick cow!\"\nYou see a nitty, but to me, I see a little girl\nWho ain't deserved the life she got, 0 chance in this written world\nShe found a needle 'round, she fill it up and flick it out\nEverybody see her but ignore her, they ain't lookin' down\nShe put the dodgy needle all under her skin, pushed it in and knew she fucked it up\nThinking this is it, Liz died petrified\nYou build your line in hopes to better life, I get it\nBut there's two sides to that coin, I have to emphasize\n[Outro]\nAh, ArrDee, Daily Duppy\nFree PMEmbed"

(Hahahaha, Tekky)\nWhere no one can see (Uh, uh, uh, ArrDee, ArrDee)\nSo don't be shy (Hey)\n\n[Chorus: ArrDee & Kyla]\nWe get wavy, smashed (Baby)\nSun comes out, splash\nShe likes my style, ain't flash\nI'm the vibe, I'm runnin' the gaff\nWe don't take it slow, full speed 'til we crash (You made me)\nMan pay the price on the tab\nHello mate, you wanna levitate? (Huh?)\nCome see the man with a plan (Hey)\nWe get wavy (Huh?), smashed (Baby)\nSun com\u0435s out, splash\nShe likes my style, ain't flash (No way)\nI'm th\u0435 vibe, I'm runnin' the gaff\nWe don't take it slow, full speed 'til we crash (You made me)\nMan pay the price on the tab\nHello mate (Hello mate), you wanna levitate? (Hahaha)\nCome see the man with a plan (Come)\n[Verse 1: ArrDee]\nBaby, if you wanna spend the night, it's alright\nBut, you gotta check out in the mornin'\nI ain't gonna be there snorin'\nI'ma slaughter, and I'ma keep on slaughterin' (Yeah)\nI get good girls movin' appallin' (Huh?)\nBad girls and I still put my all in (Yeah)\nPosh girls, but, they still move borin'\nChav girls, no caller ID callin' (Hey)\nI don't care myself, I'm chavy (Baby)\nI beat blue tick girls in a alley (Hah)\nStill palley with Megan and Magey\nI'll bottle the boyfriend and leave with the baddie (Uh)\nScatty, day and night (Scatty)\nYou can roll with the boy if you play it right (Can)\nI got a girlfriend, baby, you crazy, right?\nJust told me there's one thing playin' in her mind\nShe said\u2500\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Kyla & ArrDee]\nTell me I need to know\nWhere do you wanna go? (It don't matter, come 'round)\n'Cause if you're down\nI'll take it slow (We don't take it slow, slow, slow)\nMake you lose control (Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)\nYou might also like[Chorus: ArrDee & Kyla]\nWe get wavy, smashed (Baby)\nSun comes out, splash\nShe likes my style, ain't flash\nI'm the vibe, I'm runnin' the gaff\nWe don't take it slow, full speed 'til we crash (You made me)\nMan pay the price on the tab\nHello mate, you wanna levitate?

Tell me your name\"\nDon't know how to rhyme, I hate that game\nIf I guess your sign, that's worth at least brain\nAnd even if I'm wrong, happy birthday chain (Chain, chain)\nI like your star, you got a attitude (Baby, yeah)\nWe'll be great, let me fill you with gratitude\nShe smilin' like, \"You know what my man will do?\"\nI said, \"Tell me, babe, I don't have a clue\"\nKnow what rappers do, now, imagine that\nOnly double the magnitude\nSaid, \"I ain't a fan of you\" (Why?)\nBut, you're fit, and I'm down\nAnd before I can back off you, tell me (Tell me)\n[Pre-Chorus: Kyla & ArrDee]\nTell me I need to know\nWhere do you wanna go? (It don't matter, come 'round)\n'Cause if you're down\nI'll take it slow (We don't take it slow, slow, slow)\nMake you lose control (Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)\n\n[Chorus: ArrDee & Kyla]\nWe get wavy, smashed (Baby)\nSun comes out, splash (Ba-ba-ba\u2014)\nShe likes my style, ain't flash\nI'm the vibe, I'm runnin' the gaff\nWe don't take it slow, full speed 'til we crash (You made me)\nMan pay the price on the tab (Mad)\nHello mate, you wanna levitate? (Huh?)\nCome see the man with a plan\nWe get wavy, smashed (Baby)\nSun comes out, splash\nShe likes my style, ain't flash\nI'm the vibe, I'm runnin' the gaff\nWe don't take it slow, full speed 'til we crash (You made me)\nMan pay the price on the tab\nHello mate, you wanna levitate? (Hello mate)\nCome see the man with a plan (Hahaha, come through)\n\n[Outro: Kyla & ArrDee]\nDo you mind if I take you home tonight?\nStay another day, if that's okay\nTell me, baby\nWould you mind if I take you home with me?\nWhere no one can see (Hello mate, you wanna levitate?)\nSo don't be shy (Come see the man with a plan)1Embed"

I got what I wished, can't take it away\n\n[Chorus]\nAyy, late night driving, it's 5 a.m. on the M-way\nI've been in the booth all night\nGivin' my all just so they can press play\nAin't seen Mum in a month and I miss her\nBut I'm grafting in the best way\nWhen you've been on your arse so long\nThis shit hit different, do you comprende?\nLate night driving, it's 5 a.m. on the M-way\nI've been in the booth all night\nGivin' my all just so they can press play\nAin't seen Mum in a month and I miss her\nBut I'm grafting in the best way\nWhen you've been on your arse so long\nThis shit hit different, do you comprende?\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nI've been gettin' bigger, and so has the love, but it don't seem real\nThe closer I get to the top, the more lonely that I feel\nThe more that I walk in hot, the more the aroma's givin' me chills\nI ain't into talkin' much but I've got more raps than a trap boy deals\nThe town gets live in the night but I ain't have bread so I yakked then chilled\nThey call me the liveliest guy, the survival in I can't match, that's real\nI ain't got the time anymore, they tell me I've changed, I tell 'em I've grown\nI walk on the road, I ain't on my own, I still feel alone, I smile and roll\n\n[Chorus]\nAyy, late night driving, it's 5 a.m. on the M-way\nI've been in the booth all night\nGivin' my all just so they can press play\nAin't seen Mum in a month and I miss her\nBut I'm grafting in the best way\nWhen you've been on your arse so long\nThis shit hit different, do you comprende?\nLate night driving, it's 5 a.m. on the M-way\nI've been in the booth all night\nGivin' my all just so they can press play\nAin't seen Mum in a month and I miss her\nBut I'm grafting in the best way\nWhen you've been on your arse so long\nThis shit hit different, do you comprende?\n[Outro]\n(HARGO production)Embed"

I started from nothing\nNothing but a dream, the vision I saw, I've vividly drawn, precision\nThe life that I'm living is written\nSome of the papers are crippled and torn\nBut who woulda thought? Said, who woulda\u2014\nSaid, who woulda thought?\nMaybe my dreams ain't quite what they bought\nWho woulda thought?\nI guess I'm chasing gold coming from stone\n[Verse 1: ArrDee]\nI knew that I'd have what it takes (What it takes)\nMy foot on the gas, ain't pressin' no brakes\nI can take you back to regular days, still fresh in my brain (My brain)\nStill feels like yesterday\nThis time last year, just turned eighteen\nNo cak\u0435, all cream\nA broke arse kid from Brighton with a big dr\u0435am\nAnd I still believed\nI was writin' bars, workin' in a warehouse\nIt was only music I cared 'bout\nCut off my girl, my friends, my family, I got my head down\nThe bars came to my head while I was in bed and I ain't goin' bed now\nBorn for this, normal kid, if I can do this, you can do it all, trust me\nWe're all clueless but we ain't lucky\nBeen through shit, kept it movin'\nNow we're too lit, can't nobody touch me, reborn, ha\nI find that shit funny, man, who would have thought?\nI mean, of course, but who would have thought? Who woulda\u2014\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Lola Young]\nI've grown, I've fought, I've been reborn\n'Cause that's what life taught me\nAnd now, who woulda thought that I'd be chasing gold, coming from stone?\n\n[Chorus: Lola Young]\nBroken homes, broken homes\nAnd I've been chasing gold, coming from stone\nBroken homes, broken homes\nAnd I've been chasing gold, coming from stone\nYou might also like[Verse 2: ArrDee, and Lola Young]\nWe flipped it (Flipped it)\nNow it's all litness, tell 'em we did it (We did it)\nI've got God, I'm still the same kiddy (Ha)\nBut I won't go back to that place, I admit it (No way)\nBroken homes, they're just building bricks\n'Cause all that pain, it helped build the kid\nStill healing (Still), with a feeling (Huh)\nOf bein' on top, nuttin' can beat it (Nuttin')\nThe hurdles, I beat it (Beat it)\nNow the girlies I'm beatin' are ten out of ten\nMy brother, my friends\nAnd I still got love for the roots 'til the end ('Til the end)\nForever, for sure\nTrue, life ain't the same anymore\nI was just that kid from the shore\nAnd now I'm on top of the world\nMan, who woulda thought?\n\n[Bridge: ArrDee, Lola Young, Both]\nWhy do I feel like I've been here before? I started from nothing\nNothing but a dream, the vision I saw, I've vividly drawn, precision (Hmm)\nThe life that I'm living is written (Hmm, hmm)\nSome of the papers are crippled and torn (Hmm)\nBut who woulda thought?
