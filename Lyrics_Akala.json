   "lyrics": "Fire in the Booth Lyrics[Verse 1: Akala]\nYes, I grew up on the dole in a single parent family\nBeen through a little bit of tragedy\nYes I was around drugs and violence before the day that I started secondary\nAnd that\u2019s part of it not half of it, get the picture, the rest ain\u2019t necessary\nGrowing up, got a little caught up, but that ain\u2019t even half of my life\nAlso given the knowledge of self\nThat is all we actually need to survive\nIf you saw me aged nine, reading Malcolm just fine\nTeachers still treated me stupid\nStudents that couldn\u2019t speak English, they put me in groups with\nAnd the irony is some of the first man to give me schooling\nYou would call gangsters but I already explained, we know what the truth is\nThey used to say \u2018Don\u2019t be like me\u2019\nYeah I got a name and dough on the street\nNight time comes, I can\u2019t sleep\nAnd that\u2019s the part that rappers don\u2019t speak\nWe don\u2019t hit the road cos we are thugs\nDon\u2019t come out the womb, wanting to sell drugs\nIf we got the right guidance and love\nWould we fight people just like us?\nHow could I knock the hustle to get by?\nHow do you think I ate as a child?\nJudge no one, done many things wrong\nI just don\u2019t boast about it songs\nBut listen to my older bars\nI was just as confused as you probably are\nBut you grow and you learn, travel and fuck up\nOne too many man you know get cut up\nOne too many man that could\u2019ve been doctors\nEnd up spending their whole life boxed up\nYou learn, if you study\nIts all set out just to make them money\nNo cover, it\u2019s all about getting poor people to fight with one another\nSo its logical that us killing our brothers, dissing our mothers\nIs right in line with the dominant philosophy of our time\nBut time is a cycle, not a line\nComes back around you regain your mind\nYou be ready for the energy I channel in my rhymes\nRemedy the pedigree, the jeopardy of mine\nWhen the world\u2019s this fucked up, lethargy\u2019s a crime\nWe can all fight with our brothers over crumbs\nFar harder to fight the one who makes guns\nWe can all talk shit and get two dollars\nFar harder to be the one who seeks knowledge\nIf we understood economics\nWe\u2019d know money\u2019s nothin\u2019\nThink nothing of it\nMoney is a means to get wealth, not the wealth itself\nDon\u2019t get confused, I\u2019m far from broke\nAll that you see me do I own\nBut I won't hang what I make around my neck\nI know from where that the diamonds came\nBut I do quite literally own a library\nThat definitely costs more than your chain\nAnd businesses, and properties\nFar from starvin\u2019, I eat quite properly\nAnd I don\u2019t care, just said it for the kids\nWho need to know that you\u2019re not broke to listen\nDon\u2019t know an asset from a liability\nThey\u2019ve never been shown or told the difference\nSo they don\u2019t change situations\nRichest man in Britain is Asian\nThat\u2019s significant, not coincidence\nAsian people build businesses\nNot by flossin', going out shoppin\u2019\nGiving out their culture for everyone\u2019s profit\nWho run\u2019s Bollywood? Indian people\nWho owns our shit?\nSo we shake our arse and dance\nAs if racism just upped and vanished\nBut has it? No its right on course\nYou\u2019re beaten so bad, you\u2019re trained to ignore\nLet me not just make sweeping statements\nGimme a second, I\u2019ll explain it\nFor small amounts of drug possession there\u2019s more black people in jail in America than there is for rape and armed robbery and murder all put together\nYou can say they\u2019re just locking up thugs\nImagine if they locked up every middle class kid that had ever held drugs\nOh that\u2019s right, that\u2019d be your kids!\nBigger than that what is going on with this\nPrison in America\u2019s a private business\nThey get paid fifty-k per year per inmate by the State, just wait\u2026\nAlso legally are allowed to use their prison inmates as slaves\nCheap slave labour, big corporations\nThey come out of jail, can\u2019t get a job\nSo when we celebrate going to jail\nWe are literally celebrating enslavement\nAdd to that, that the hood that you\u2019re livin\u2019\nEngineered social condition that breeds crime by design\nWhere do you think you get your nine?\nYou can say that they\u2019re just black\nBut I like to deal with facts\nIn the 1920s you would\u2019ve found in America\nBlack Towns\nProspering centres of economics and education to make you proud\nBut some people couldn\u2019t bear that the former slaves would not just lie down\nSo the KKK and other hate groups burnt those towns to the ground\nKillin hundreds\nIf it ain\u2019t understood\nYou think you were always livin\u2019 in the hood?\nShit it\u2019s only been sixty years\nSince they hung blacks and burned em\u2019\nAnd that was so cool\nThey were your pastors' picnic baskets\nEven gave kids the day off school\nTo go see a lynching; have a picnic\nIt\u2019s fun to watch the little monkeys die\nThen people act a little dysfunctional\nYou wanna pretend that you don\u2019t know why\nIf your colour means you can be killed\nAnd you\u2019re powerless to get justice about it\nIs it difficult to figure out how you would then end up feelin\u2019 about it?\nAnd that ain\u2019t excuses\nJust dealing with the roots of abuses that make a reality\nWhere a generation of young men speak of ourselves as dirt casually\nThat\u2019s America\nThis Britain\nSome things are similar\nSome different\nIn this country the first enslaved were the working class\nWhat\u2019s changed?\nWorst jobs, worst conditions\nWorst taxed, look where you\u2019re livin\u2019\nYou go to the pub, Friday night\nYou will fight with a guy, don\u2019t know what for\nBut won\u2019t fight with a guy, suit and a tie\nWho sends your kids to die in a war\nThey don\u2019t send the kids of the rich or politicians\nIt\u2019s your kids, the poor British\nThat they send to go die in a foreign land\nFor these wars you don\u2019t understand\nYeah they say that you\u2019re British\nAnd that lovely patriotism they feed ya'\nBut in reality, you have more in common with immigrants\nThan with your leaders\nI know, both side of my family\nBlack and white are fed ghetto mentality\nReality in this system\nPoor people are dirt regardless of shade\nBut with that said\nLet\u2019s not pretend that everything is the same\nWhen our grandparents came here to Britain\nIf you had a criminal record you couldn\u2019t get in\nYet that ain\u2019t protect them from all the stupid, stupid abuses they would be livin\u2019\nKicked in the teeth, stabbed in the street\nMany times fired bombed our houses\nPut faeces through our letterbox\nAnd of course the cops did so much about it\nDaily, up to the eighties\nPeople spittin\u2019 into my pram cos\u2019 I was a coon baby\nBut of course, that has had no effect on why today we are crazy\nAnd none of this was for any good reason\nThey were just dark and breathing\nTo ease the guilt now for all of this treatment\nConstant stereotypes are needed\nSo if I celebrate how big that my dick is, bricks that I\u2019m flippin\u2019\nClips that I\u2019m stickin\u2019, chicks that I\u2019m hittin\u2019, I\u2019m playing my position\nBut if I teach a kid to be a mathematician, messin\u2019 with the schism\nHow they gonna fill a prison when materialism is nothing but a religion?\nWhat do you think we got now in Britain?\nJust like America, private prisons\nPrisons for profit!\nThat mean when your kids go jail people make money off it\nSo keep environments that breed crime\nBuild more jails at the same time\nMarket badness to the kids in the rhymes\nAs long as rich kids ain\u2019t dying, it's fine!\nGet em\u2019 to the point where some are so lost\nThey actually believe that if they don\u2019t celebrate killin\u2019 themselves off\nThat it\u2019s because they\u2019re soft\nWas Malcolm soft? Was Marley soft?\nTell me was Marcus Garvey soft?\nWell? Was Mohammed Ali soft? Nah, Nah I think not!\nBut they want us to think that the road is cool\nBeing on road is all we can do\nWe don\u2019t control the wholesale productions\nWho benefits from us movin\u2019 the food?\nOr thinking there\u2019s no way out of road life\nBut Malcolm X used to hustle out on the roadside\nWhen Marcus Garvey organised more than six million people\nWith no Facebook or Twitter\nWhy is this something you cannot equal?\nShit!\nOne of my homeboys did a ten straight in the box in yard\nNow, what\u2019s he doing? Passin\u2019 his doctorate\nDon\u2019t tell me that it\u2019s too hard!\nWho trained you to believe that you\u2019re inferior?\nSungbo Eredo in Nigeria are the remains of an ancient moat\nDug one-thousand years ago\nTwenty metres wide, seventy down\nRound the remains of an ancient town\nThat\u2019s four-hundred square miles around\nFour-hundred square miles around\nPlease, please don\u2019t believe me\nIt was a documentary on BBC\nBut we ain\u2019t studyin\u2019 history\nToo busy watching MTV\nAnd MTV said wear platinum\nNow everybody wanna go and wear platinum\nAnd MTV said pop magnums\nNow everybody wanna go and pop magnums\nIf MTV said drink prune juice\nYou would start hearing that in tunes soon\n\"Hey! Today I wore my Cartier\nIs it now more important what I got to say?\"\nOh and I drive a Mercedes by the way\nSo everybody listen to what I got to say\nHuh, does that make you all happy?\nAh but shit my head\u2019s still nappy\nThink for myself, still some mad at me\nBut on the mic ain\u2019t not one bad as me\nAll of this here\u2019s good for the rhymes\nPut us in the same place at the same time\nAnd it\u2019s clear to everybody that I\u2019m out of my mind\nSome of these guys are runnin\u2019 out of their rhymes\nClear to everybody that has got ears\nI\u2019m the guy that they just might fear\nThey wanna get near but they can\u2019t have a peer\nAh dear I\u2019m hard liquor you\u2019re just like beer\nFront on the kid for another five years\nCome to my shows and some cry tears\nIt mean that much to em\u2019, it\u2019s a movement!\nI don\u2019t speak for myself but a unit\nBlack, white, man, woman, anyone that respects truth we put in\nDudes are like no dinner with just puddin\u2019\nYeah you\u2019re sweet but no substance puddin\u2019\nYou could never ever be with a level on\nOur songs get outplayed out there in Lebanon\nWe speak for the people properly\nNot for the old fat guys in offices\nAnd the girls love him, it ain\u2019t fair\nHe can\u2019t even be bothered to comb his hair\nAnyway that\u2019s enough kissin\u2019 my own arse\nBack to the more important task of being so shower\nI got half the hood screaming \u201cknowledge is power\u201d\nAnd I ain\u2019t saying that will change rap\nBut I do know this for a fact\nRight now there\u2019s a youte on your block\nWith his hand on his cock and his face screwed up\nSwear he don\u2019t care, don\u2019t give a fuck\nThat he won\u2019t let nobody call his bluff\nBut the words go in\nOpen up your chakra\nBecause once that\u2019s happened there\u2019s no going back\nOnce you start to see what is really happening\nWho the enemy you should be attackin\u2019 is\nSo read, read, read!\nStuck on the block, read, read!\nSittin\u2019 in the box, read, read!\nDon\u2019t let them say what you can achieve\n'Cause when people are enslaved\nOne of the first things they do is stop them reading\n'Cause it is well understood that intelligent people will take their freedom\n'Cause if we knew our power we would understand that we can\u2019t be held down\nIf we knew our power, we would not elevate not one of these clowns\nIf we knew our power, we wouldn\u2019t get arrogant when we get two pennies\nIf we knew our power, we would see what everybody sees, that we\u2019re rich already!\nBut never mind MCs go run for your mummy\nI\u2019m hungry, I run for my tummy\nThat\u2019s enough, back to worshipping money\nI\u2019m off, back to the study!You might also like24Embed"

It was the only one Bob Marley ever did play in Africa\nYou write raps, I write history on the page\nAnd quite literally, an elder statesman to my own generation\nAn inspiration cause the flows that I came with is a solo play by Miles Davis\nWho don\u2019t know he\u2019s the greatest?\nSo if Charlie tells anybody else their fire in the booth is the best there\u2019s been\nIs he high? Does he lie?\nNah, he knows that I\u2019m in my own league\n[Verse 2]\nI\u2019m judged totally separate\nIf we are actually going on the evidence\nYou wanna be a foe? Do you know what the level is?\nYou wanna be a pro? Can you roll with the cleverest?\nGenius, I know it\nKinda like a road side thug yet a poet\nKinda like a warrior, kinda like a scholar\nBut I can be an asshole, don\u2019t make me show it\nI know a certain kind of supporters\nDon\u2019t like it when I get this boasty\nYou think that I care?\nAll that show, you don\u2019t really know me\nSee, I\u2019m an arrogant fuck on the mic\nI am not humble, I\u2019m only nice in real life\nWho wants an MC that does not think they\u2019re the shit?\nThat defeats the whole point - combat sport's this rap stuff\nThat\u2019s why a man gets slapped when he act up\nThey cannot catch us, they will get backed up\nYou can feel the energy coming through the chakras\nNo aggression, the hood\u2019s not listening\nCause aggression is what they\u2019re living in\nSo I keep spittin\u2019 it, everyday I\u2019m spinning \u2018em\nCall me Akala, there is no synonym\nNobody\u2019s similar, not the same\nI rap about life, they rap about chains\nYet, we all get dough and we all drive Mercs\nAll do festivals, all get work\nWe don\u2019t all lecture at Oxford with a hoodie on\nCause I got no response for their nonsense\nDon\u2019t all do education in warzones, man are shook to go Peckham\nDespite all the big talk\nThey would not walk in half of the places I step in\nCatch me in anyone\u2019s hood on my own\nKids act like they seen a ghost\nI\u2019m like little bro, \"I\u2019m thirty-two years old, you think I care about a postcode?\"\nI am not invincible, I could get removed from the physical\nBut if I get murked, probably be political\nCause the things that come out of my mouth is a madness\nI am a rebellious bastard with no respect for authority\nSo I don\u2019t suggest that you follow me\nIt\u2019s true this could all end horribly\nBut I\u2019ll still be the anomaly, an entrepreneur\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nI don\u2019t say it cause it sounds cool, it\u2019s actually true\nAin\u2019t got a diamond chain, I admit it\nBut I do got an office with employees in it\nDo take youngsters all around the globe\nGet them paid for their brain and their lyrics\nWhile our media want to still paint us like we are just nothing but crooks\nAlong comes one so cool\nHe can make it cool to rap about books\nAnd you can think that\u2019s neeky and stupid\nBut all that shows that you\u2019re clueless\nCause the global revenue for books every year is like ten times more than music\nHmmmm, now I have sold how many books?\nAnd self-publish, how does that look?\nFor those that only respect cheques\nSwear the accountant ain\u2019t cookin\u2019 the books, son\nAnd I don\u2019t even think that capitalism should decide how you rate a rap on a rhythm\nThat is the age we\u2019re living in, isn\u2019t it?\nIt\u2019s all about materialism\nMore important than any paper debt, do you check for the youthdem?\nLet\u2019s see, any one of them little thugs right there\nHe could have been me, he could have been me\nIt could have been me\n\n[Verse 4]\nFifteen, I was in chimes[?] and trends\nColiseum way back then surrounded by big men\nIn the clap of a skeng\nYou know what was being smoked in green, but everybody pretends\nThis time I kicked ball for the Hammers\nWeed and the girls put a spanner in the matters\nFact of the matter is, lost my discipline\nLate night bredrin, whip with a stick in it\nHe took it from under his dad\u2019s mattress\nI never grew up with dad, who\u2019s better off?\nComplicated, I\u2019m undercompensating\nEverybody talks road, I let \u2018em fake it\nMy olders would organize crime, they lick banks\nSo I ain\u2019t gassed when you say you bag grams\nBadman, what's that? Madman, stop that\nThey manufacture gats, we just pop that\nThey import, export, we just shot that\nHustle, I ain\u2019t saying I knock that\nI\u2019m just saying we should see it\u2019s deliberate\nAnd by now we should all be sick of it\nI\u2019m working on ways to get rid of it\nMass incarceration, ridiculous\nSo I go to jail and I chat to the mandem\nFire in the Booth Part 1\nWhat I rapped them? Explaining the system and how it will trap them\nAction more than rap then, hmm\nAll my Fire in the Booths, they have been studied as texts\nBy countless PhDs \u2018round the globe\nMy youth now have some respect\nAnd they still bang on the block, from Brixton to Brooklyn\nPalestine to West Papua\nBut despite all the personal comfort, I still feel sick when I think of the massacres\nThe world is fucked\nThere is enough to go around, but we are ruled by -(cunts)-\n\"There he goes preaching again\nAkala, Stick to the script, just stunt\nTell \u2018em about your whip, brand new something and sit\nHow many girls wanna...\nWell cuz\u2019, come on, let\u2019s be honest\nI was not ugly before this shit\n[Verse 5]\nSo you can imagine, but the brain power you cannot fathom\nI mean it truly from the bottom of my heart\nThough please jump on the bandwagon\nI\u2019ve made it cool to be conscious again, say thanks\nCause I know that you\u2019ve got more sense\nI know that you know yourself\nWhen you are sat down with your gran and her friends\nThat\u2019s our culture, respect for the olders\nIf you snort coke then we call you a cokehead, no biggie\nWant to rap with Akala? So silly\nI\u2019m like my gran\u2019s name, so Millie\nTen years first album, ten years no daytime play\nBut in October we\u2019re selling out KOKO\nCome along learn about a show and a stage\nNo hype man, no cupping a mic\nMusicians and visuals all mixed right\nAnd like forty songs squeezed into an hour and a half\nThe supporters actually like\nConsistency matters the rest is just package\nImagining these rappers is tragic\nSitting at home, having to watch me\nThey\u2019re like, \"I swear its black magic, yeah, black magic, Griot, tradition of the rappers\nI studied my craft, you mandem are slackers\nBow in the presence of greatness\nCause you\u2019re only trained to rate fakeness\nLove that I get is so overwhelming\nI don\u2019t even see no haters, yeah\nFew men have got more status, but which one has more respect?\nThat\u2019s what I thought, Akala\u2019s the one that they still can\u2019t get\n\n[Verse 6]\nCause I\u2019m like Dennis Brown meets DMX\nI\u2019m like Shabba and Brockie and Det\nBurning down old school, Stratford Rex\nI feel sorry for whoever comes next\nThat\u2019s like running after Usain Bolt\nThat\u2019s like singing after John Holt\nThat\u2019s like trying to floss on the Pope\nHe\u2019s so beyond money he tries to act broke\nI\u2019m like every book written at once\nSo I got the youths\u2019 head fucked like Skunk\nLittle bit of reggae mixed with a bit of punk\nAnd the discipline of a Buddhist monk\nLike, how it feels when you come she comes at the same time, now you are one\nOof, you would swear there\u2019s a god when you\u2019re done\nEven if you don\u2019t believe in one, son\nAll of my children have left the building\nCharlie can\u2019t have them back, cause I have killed \u2018em\nIf I don\u2019t feel them, they ain\u2019t real then\nFate is sealed then\nJust don\u2019t deliberate over the Illa State soldier\nThe middle weight roller, didn't we take over?\nDidn\u2019t we take over? The middle weight roller\nThe Illa State soldier, deliberate over\n\n[Verse 7]\nLines that I rhyme with a force\nSo hard it\u2019s separating your mind from your thoughts\nKnow that I am inclined to divorce\nYour little big mouth from the height of your horse\nSee it\u2019s a sign of the times that we walk\nThose that talk sense get outlined in chalk\nThose that talk shit get a line of support\nRight round the block for the minds that they bought\nFor the dominant philosophy, the legal armed robbery\nThe global monopoly that\u2019s fucking up the only planet that we got\nIf I had my way I\u2019d tell the truth, I\u2019d let them rot\nBut unfortunately, it\u2019s not, fuck off\nThis is so easy I love this shit but I\u2019m almost bored\nI could write one of these every month\nBut to give them a chance I only wrote four, cor\n\n[Verse 8]\nMan are not training\nThey\u2019re not ready for the levels of Shaolin\nThat\u2019s almost an hour of bars, my dog\nNone of which is on my albums\nAnd I got six, and I write books and plays and scripts\nStill find time to go teach in the bits\nWho told you that he\u2019s not the shit?\nWell, a bloody liar he is\n\n[Verse 9]\nA wha' dis? Dis lickle idiot try chat to me, you know me can't feel it\nA boy try swarm me\nYour eyes, dem tarly too damn big for your belly\nNot on your nellie, not on your life\nCould you find one to touch him on the mic? Yeah right\nImagine a famous rapper from the States barrin\u2019 for ten minutes straight\nWith the bloody cheek to do it double time, every time\nHow much piss does he take?\nKnows that he\u2019s great, knows that you\u2019re fake\nKnows that he won\u2019t ever barf on your mate\nKnows that you\u2019re late\nLook how they anticipate every word that I say when I speak\nCause it\u2019s the knowledge of Timbuktu\nMixed with the slang of a London youth\nAdding in the heart and the soul of blues\nMy youth, now how can I not go true?\nHalf of a cracker, plus half of a coon\nHalf of a celt, plus half a maroon\nIf I'm feeling anything that\u2019s close to half-hearted\nYou\u2019re half more than half doomed\nHalf of my tune contains more content than every single thing you\u2019d ever do\nGassin\u2019 is easy, but only a few can spit content and still slew\nI\u2019m sure you noticed it\u2019s true, true\nOne of them is not you\nYou wot?\n\n[Verse 10]\nYou wanna have a barney?\nWith the magic mountain machine gun army?\nWith the only one that is channeling Marley?\nYou watch rappers while I\u2019m studying Garvey\nLeft that, we can all see who\u2019s the best at\nYou came for connect four, I came for a chess match\nNot the same league, even the same sport\nLiterally hundreds of stamps in the passport\nNot the same league, even the same sport\nLiterally hundreds of stamps in the passport\nAnd I ain\u2019t diss black women, to make my livin\u2019\nSo who\u2019s more successful then him?\nYeah I got love in my heart\nBut it\u2019s not all peace and love, nah nah are you kidding?\nYes there are things worth killing and dying for\nEnds ain\u2019t one of them tho, why you lying for?\nNow if a man runs in your house\nThumps your mum on the side of her mouth\nWho in the right mind wouldn\u2019t understand why you ended up taking him out?\nYes, love is not soft or sorry\nLove is so tough it can make your mum catch a body\nLove\u2019s the only thing worth killing and dying for\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned in my time on this Earth\nThink that I\u2019m wrong? Go to a lifer\u2019s wing\nLook the mandem in the eyes\nDone that many times, got one too many rhymes\nThe London in my lines, a dungeon for these guys\nQuestioned them to find, a hundred at a time\nMuster and define, the cusp of what is rhyme\nClutchin\u2019 and I climb, I pop the level line\nWas always at the top, but now they recognize\nTrust that you recline when I go double time\nThe flow is so ridiculous, I be the prophesised\nGuys are ill-advised to dive into a fight\nWith I, the wicked eye, you will never get a blight\n\n-Ruins Of Empire Piece-\n\n[Verse 11]\nAnd it seems I was there\nWhere? Everywhere\nEvery battle ever fought\nEvery stab, every shot\nThrough the ages of humans, this killing machine\nI could feel everything though\nIt wasn\u2019t a dream\nI was every soldier that had ever fought\nWith a shield and a sword\nAll the blood ever drawn\nFrom a dagger, or a bayonet\nAn axe that will slay your neck\nAutomatic gats that clap only spraying, death\nI was in a tank that exploded in Iraq\nIn a drive-by in gang wars spraying out of cars\nI was in \u2018Nam, dropping napalm, but it burned my skin\nI was also Viet Minh\nI was an Italian massacring Ethiopians\nBut the bullets only pierced my flesh because I was both of them\nI could feel every single wound of the flesh\nBut also the pleasure of causing the death\nI was a soldier of the Caliphate on a crusade, a killer\nUsing Christ in exactly the same way\nI was every woman ever killed in a witch hunt\nOr every little girl forced to grow with a split soul\nCause men like to snip clits and zip bits closed\nSo the rape feels nice\nBefore they take my life\nI was fighting for liberation, a woman and general\nBringing death to cowards that sold my genitals\nOne moment I killed to be freed\nThe next, I was a monarch that killed for my greed\nThutmose the Third\nAlexander the Fake\nCaesar, Napoleon, Francis Drake\nThe arms of the state, the armies that are great\nBut I was also the resistance that\u2019s hardly ever praised\nI was every indigenous person of America\nThat died trying to protect their homes from a predator\nThen the robe-cladden Roman senator\nAnd every noble that showed you the ways of the treacherous\nI was in the Belgian Congo hacking off limbs\nIn Rwanda, Akazu doing the same thing\nI was a Japanese general occupying the Philippines\nA Filipino child too young to know what it means\nI was at Sharpeville, I was just two\nMy mother, with a bullet in her head, and I knew\nBarely out of her womb, I played with her wound\nI knew life was a cycle, she\u2019ll be back soon\nI was a soldier of Ashanti resisting the British\nBut at the same time still selling humans to the Dutch\nIf you\u2019re honest with yourself and you look back through human history you\u2019d see that we\u2019re totally fucked\nCause I was that little girl in that church in Alabama\nThen a grand-wizard, then Margaret Sanger\nThen I was Paul Warfield Tibbets Jr\nFeeling just fine in a B-29\nI did my job\nOne-hundred thousand dead\n-(Greasy. Yellow. Japs)-\nI went home to relax\nThen I was every child ever born with deformed limbs\nCause they were just pawns on a board to inform kings\nI saw sharks following ships, intrigued by the trail that comes overboard\nI saw sharks following the ship I was on I knew then that it couldn\u2019t be long\nWe had tried to get free\nBut as if that were wrong\nWe were thrown overboard from the deck of the Zong\nSo many bodies that the sharks couldn\u2019t finish the flesh\nIt took the waves to administer death\nAnd I joined the rest at the bottom of the sea\nThe uncounted millions that dreamed to be free\nThe next minute I was back on a ship\nThis time as a soldier of the French\nRight off the coast of Haiti we made a gas chamber for African rebels, I couldn\u2019t deal with the stench\nThen my head was chopped off\nBy one of Dessalines\u2019 henchmen\nHe gave the order for killing all Frenchmen\nThen all I could see was pyramids\nCan you see?\nDesigned by man's mind but built by his greed\nThe strangest pyramids, I ever did see\nWas not built by stones, but the bones of families6Embed"

   "lyrics": "The Thieves Banquet Lyrics[Intro: Akala (speaking)]\nOnce upon a time in an obscure part of the Milky Way Galaxy, there was a spinning ball of water and rock ruled by the forces of evil.\nThe Devil himself, proud of the magnificent achievements of his children, decided to call a special banquet for the greatest thieves in all the land\nHe sent invites to thousands of the greatest murders, rapists and general-assorted scum, inviting them to attend his palace at the dawn of the new moon. Each thief would be given a chance to stake his claim as the greatest messenger of murder upon the planet, and the Devil himself would then decide who should be crowned king.\nAfter many days of deliberating, all of the petty thieves, such as street criminals, have been found far short of the required level of wickedness and there were just four sets of thieves left in the competition\nThey were: the monarchs of empire, a cartel of bankers, the heads of religious orders, and the third-world dictators. Each set of thieves appointed a spokesman to give his case to the Devil. We have recorded these events for posterity\n\n[Verse 1 Intro: Akala]\nUh, listen\nUh, okay, yo\nFirst up was the thief of the worst reputation\nDictator of a third-world nation\nHe looked the Devil in the eye as he spoke\nIn an oh-so-serious tone\n[Verse 1: Akala (as the Third-World Dictator)]\nDear Mr. Devil\nI am the greatest thief there has ever been on Earth\nPlease tell me who else more than me personifies your work\nI came to power in a military coup, I murdered the elected president\nHe wanted to use the resources of our country for our peoples\u2019 benefit\nI proved to masters in the west\nI could kill my own people just as well as the best\nSo I took over the so-called independent country when the foreigners left\nSent squads of death to those who would suggest\nIn power should be the one they elect\nErected a statue of the great man\nThat raped our mothers, stole our lands\nThat\u2019s how little self-respect I have\nDon\u2019t fight slavery, it makes me glad\nAccount in Switzerland, Rolls Royce\nMurder and rape cos I want new toys\nDon\u2019t want a portion, but a whole fortune\nWith that profit, what\u2019s a little bit of torture\nEven outlawed my indigenous culture\nAnd language and history\nAnd taught our people to only worship colonizers\nAnd of course, ME!\n\n[Hook]:\nThief!\nIt\u2019s the banquet of the thieves!\nCome and dine with me!\nIt\u2019s the banquet of the thieves!\nThe banquet of the thieves\u2026\nYou might also like[Verse 2 Intro: Akala]\nThe Devil was so impressed with this wonderful man\nHe almost ejaculated on his hands\nBut the monarch of the empire said\n\n[Verse 2: Akala (as the Monarch of Empire)]\nExcuse me, Mr. Devil, I\u2019d like to speak if I may\nWho do you think trained this amateur dictator to behave this way?\nYeah, I\u2019m sure before I came along his country was far from heaven\nBut look of the carnage I caused all over the Earth, it\u2019s got to be the work of the Devil\nCountless deaths, mass enslavement\nDeliberate starvation of whole nations\nThe dictator tries his best, but looking at me, he\u2019s just an imitation\nWho do you think pays his wages?\nHe would love to be trading places\nI\u2019ve been doing this ting on the roads\nWay back, way back, way back\nSince the Middle Ages\nEverybody knows he\u2019s a criminal element\nThey think I\u2019m democratic and benevolent\nAnd that shows that I\u2019m really devilish\nCos people think I\u2019m heaven-sent\nI couldn\u2019t care about democracy\nYou all know no one elected me\nThe people love me despite my crimes\nSucka MCs wanna bite my shine\nSo blingin\u2019 out of control you would vomit\nDon\u2019t even touch dough, but my face is on it!\n[Hook]:\n\n[Verse 3: Akala (as the Head of Religious Orders)]\nI\u2019m a pervert who\u2019s in the cloak of the clergy\nYes, I\u2019m a pervert who uses the cloak\nI\u2019m a despicable character\nI use my position of authority and spiritual reverence\nI\u2019m a despicable character\n\nMr. Devil, allow me to speak\nFor all of the religious leaders that leech\nIn the world of creeps, I\u2019m initiated\nI take the peoples\u2019 faith and dissipate it\nWith false promises, hollow oratory\nDon\u2019t need a gun, it\u2019s daylight robbery\nDear Mr. Devil\nI thought you would like it\nHow I use their faith in God to keep them blinded\nPut on a nice voice, read them a book\nAnd they believe that I am not a crook\nTell them God will repay them in the next\nThey give me their life savings so I can buy jets\nAll the reports about child sex\nNone of us have ever gone to jail yet\nThis system of stealing, so appealing\nConvinces the victims their lives have meaning\nMonarchs boast about conquest\nBut needed my blessings to get it done\nAnd all of the dictators use my books\nTherefore, they are just my sons\n\n[Verse 4 Intro: Akala]\nThe Devil was sure this was the winner\nAnd was just about to put an end to the dinner\nBut then the man from the banking cartel\nStepped up and said\n\n[Verse 4: Akala (as the Cartel Banker)]\nI think I\u2019m the biggest sinner\nAll of those three depend on me\nAll they ever do is defending me\nCos I paid for all of the things they have\nOf course, and all of the lives they lead\nPaid for the guns, bombs and the tanks\nThat\u2019s why you see, there is always more\nI turned science\u2019s basic appliance\nInto a client of weapon and war\nPaid for monarchies, armed robberies\nI make monopolies out of property\nNever shot a gun nor killed anyone myself\nBut billions die cos of me\nWho needs a threat? I make a debt\nOut of thin air, just sit back and collect\nEvery single day, whatever they say\nThe people need me just to connect it\nYet none of them knows what I look like\nYet all of them spend my money to look nice\nThey want more, no one\u2019s pure\nI hold the keys to every single door\nSell sex and drugs, profit and lies\nEarth and skies, I\u2019ll even sell life\nI\u2019ll even sell freedom for the right price\nBut no one is smart enough to ask me nice\nSo Mr. Devil, give me the medal\nDon\u2019t be biased\nIf you don\u2019t give it to me\nI\u2019ll just BUY IT!\n\n[Hook]:\nThief!\nIt\u2019s the banquet of the thieves!\nCome and dine with me!\nIt\u2019s the banquet of the thieves!\nThe banquet of the thieves\u20266Embed"

   "lyrics": "Fire In The Booth Part 2 LyricsYo, Akala\nKnowledge is power\nVolume 1, Mixtape 28th of may Listen\nAkala music.com\nTiny bit more vocal please actually\nListen, Knowledge is power always\nListen\n\nOi, Mate my personal life's great\nSome of you would love me more, If I rubbed that in you're face\nOkay, well\nLet us run down the resume and have a little chat about how Akalas living today\nBig whip, nice yard, Been all over the globe\nLook how many continents I have done, Shows\nCouple little company's, Neat little office\nEverything going swell, Little bit of profit\nBuilt a business educating kids from the blocks\nSo far as I'm concerned you gotta be a mug to not rate him\nOwn my own masters, Still my own master\nNovels and scripts on the way\nRap is just a part of, The genius and it's said\nAnd he knows it, Dickhead, Since I used to kick ball for West ham\nWith my bighead\nBack in school days wearing hand-me downs from my sister\nAnd gal' was still onto man, Now thats some ras charisma\nAs just a nippa, I took my first pull of rizla\nAnd who you think gave me that? yeah my bigger sista\nSo when we speak of struggle cousin it's yours\nYou know the same old madness, working class poor\nYeah, So, may of won a couple awards\nBut I guarantee my family's just as messed up as yours\nAll the abuse and the alcoholism and drug addiction\nUncles going to prison\nThis is working class livin' in Britain, It ain't great\nYou gotta be kiddin'\nSo please don't ever get confused by me spittin'\nCos', yes I said the ghetto's in our head\nBut no I didn't mean that if you live next to a food yard that thats in your dreams\nI meant believing in the madness they spout about us\nIt's far more dangerous than putting us in council houses\nSo yeah I criticize but from a place of love, never, ever\nBecause I think that I've become above\nEvery young broth, you wanna judge as a tug'\nIt's me minus a little guidance and love\nSo I think that your the mug\nAnd why be smug when it's an actual fact\nWe all commit crime, Simply by paying tax\nCos' we then go and tickle the people in Iraq\nAnd ask them so politely for all their minerals we extract\nWe blew children's heads off, Set fire to backs\nWere a gangsta nation get down or you get clapped, so\nWhen you see the yout' running around on the road with heaters\nDon't be surprised, they're just copying their leaders\nLong as the wars stay in places that are brown and poor\nWe can all pretend to be abhorred but we applaud\nIf you go up to Knightsbridge and get violent\nThe police man who duppies you will probably get knighted\nIf I don't wanna fight you cuz'\nIt ain't cos' I'm frightened\nIt's just rather fight with those who really think they're titans, shit\nI ain't scared of bleeding\nI ain't scared of breathing another breath in this world where everything is so uneven\nWhere millions murdered in the Congo and it's barely news\nBut if a footballers wife should buy a pair of shoes\nI'm supposed to give a fuck apparently, I do not\nThe worlds a reflection of you're block\nAnd if you think a world that profit from their death, and be totally cool\nAnd things should be better cos' you live here, your a bloody fool\nLook around the genocidal abuse\nI swear humanity ain't nothing but a virus with shoes\nThen I pick my nephew up from school, and I look at the youths\nAnd see the love that they show each other and I'm just so confused\nBecause they ain't learnt yet what is their race or religion\nSo we're put unconditioned but we learn to play our position\nIn the system\nLook what that does to our recognition of self\nWe grow suspicion of our own intuition, listen\nAkalas sick but he raps about racism to much\nCould you imagine I gave a flying f\nCos' it's amazing, how many wanna claim they love this music\nWith no respect for the actual struggle that produced it\nDid Hip-Hop not start in segregated hoods, are them hoods not still segregated?\nSo it's really good\nAnd the first nation not still on reservations where the age of 46\nIs the average life expectation\nAnd fellas, I wonder where the Favelas, could be suddenly knocked down\nAnd replaced with something better\nIf you got sense you see fights are joined in race class and\nGender are sides of the same coin\nSo, if you really down for justice whoever the people who suffered, whoever you are\nI consider you my sisters, brothers\nBut call it what it is like Carlin or Bill Hicks\nNot these patronizing left-wing little twits who ask me dumb shit\nOn the superior tip\nAnd wanna act like cos I read I saw less violence as a kid\nDon't make me an exception\nFor your mental protection\nFrom acceptin' the madness in the system we are left in\nThat was the clearest thing to come of august events\nAll the closet bigots started speaking their minds again\nSo when a Jamaican or Asians misbehavin' of course it's because of their skin\nBlonde hair kills a million people, thats just him\nAnd it's entertaining some people are so thick\nBut I prefer that to all of the fake grins\nCos' it's the only problem people claim they wanna so but don't actually wanna talk about\nHow it evolved, You are told, this country really really yours sir?\nWhat they did to brown people they did to their own poor first\nAnd originally in the states, working class whites were also enslaved\nStill no one talks about it today\nEver since the master came with the system of privileged\nMade the working whites the overseers mulatto the house\nCos' put the darkest blacks in the field, that mind is with us still\nBillion dollar industry's, skin cream and bleaching pills\nAnd lets be honest most people of my complexion to this very day still think they're\nBetter than the darker section\nYou say it's changed then only educate me about Wilberforce not about the Africans in Haiti\nWho beat the army's of the British, Spanish and napoleon, From the moment it was stolen\nFrom em, There was no controllin' em\nWhen I was in school, she said no you never fought for freedom\nNo, we freed you and you were on your knees pleading\nAnd once more did you know that we kind of saved you from the barbarism of Africa\nYou should be grateful\nAnd enough of our own people can't be bothered to read\nThat they actually believe that we were swinging from trees\nThey don't know the kingdom of Congo had embassy's in Italy\n500 years ago, Literally\nAin't heard of Saint Maurice or Septimius Severus\nThey ain't studying the past cos' they think it's irrelevant\nAnd attempts of pretending ancient Egyptians weren't African\nNuttin' more than pseudo intellectual lies\nThey obviously ain't read what Aristotle, Herodotus said\nAbout people they saw for their own eyes and\nEgypt's been invaded since the fall of the pharaoh's\nNot once, Not twice, But many many times\nAnd nobody wants to explain why so many statues have missin' noses\nEven when those statues made of granite\nIt ain't one people alone, mis-taught about themselves\nWe live on Celtic land, But don't learn about the Celts\nThe same, Irish people you characterize as stupid\nDuring the dark ages some of the most educated living in Europe\nAnd did you learn the numbers you count with every day\nWere invented by Indian people, I bet you didn't\nOr how many million Indians fought for Britain in both world wars\nStill you got the cheek to call them immigrants\nWe don't learn about the Moors of course, for some that knowledge dangerous\nIs it a problem the impact they had on the Renaissance\nWhen people take power over another group\nWe minimize their achievements so we can make it feel true\nSo if you think Columbus was first to sail ocean blue\nYou probably believe Elvis created rock&roll too\nAnd oh, for the record no doubt I believe in peace\nBut not for one second will I turn the other cheek\nThey slap you, slap them back and take teeth\nThe only way a bully ever learn is getting beat\nFight, fire with fire nah fire with water\nSee the life you enforce is stronger than the destroyer\nThat's why these MC's can't speak to me\nNO, All men are not made equally\nMy brains made of iron fiber, conductin' the livest wire\nMy average grades higher than Oxford and Cambridge require\nI don't want credit, because I got a message\nI want credit cos' I'm the best MC\nDead it\nWhen I came out way back in 04\nSister had just won every award\nMost man would have done the bait thing\nPut big sis on the chorus chords\nThat would of been a-list or\nQuickly I would of been famous more\nBut look how I came in this ting' raw\nBang of the streets and more\nIf I MC'd and I heard me rap i'd be like what the\nI ain't never gonna' be that good so\nI better not push my luck\nIt will embarrass me\nOnly insanity, Would make you challenge me\nBetter hope if we bump heads, that day that I fee like charity\nIf not it's a beaten and ain't no use in searching for meaning\nCuz all it means is that you are crap and I am a genius\nWait I'm Panama I'll push the parameter\nCan you imagine a Pharaoh more sicker than average\nI'll kill them with character\nBenjamin Banneker\nLook at the marriage of stamina\nDamage ya\nBoy from Britannica\nGot love from the whole in the calendar, so cold that I roll in a Challenger\nWhy your men roll with the ametures\nIm too much harder\nYou can just call him Father Akala\nBut I don't talk shit like a pastor\nMany know that I'm smarter than Arthur\nBloody disaster\nFire astarter\nProbably prodigy\nMake you a martyr\nFor these crap MC's that mumble\nThen see me in the flesh and crumble\nNever told you that I was humble\nNo I'm not, Don't lie\nI'm so sure with my writing ability\nThat I feel like I'm finding divinity\nSit down and rhyme soliloquy\nMy agility, timing is Military\nWhat scene? get a Guillotine for the Mini-me\nIt seems ya'll fiend for the the mimicry\nYour team couldn't dream of this synygy\nThat I be when I scheme on a wicked beat\nThere he goes again with the big words, with bare syllables\nGet your dictionaries out\nThat's what I'm about\nClowns wanna shout\nThrash him, smash him in the mouth\nBloody professor\nMan of the letter\nI've read and I've read and I'm sure that I'm better\nNever regretting the endeavor to dead an oppressor\nI think that they're lepers that think that their pleasures are better endeavors\nDon't know about precious but\nSee me? born in a rage\nMaroon blood, coursing my veins\nAs you can see I was born for the stage\nBut, I'll never be their cultural maid\nSome say that we're political\nCos' what they're doing isn't\nDon't they preach a political doctrine called materialism\nBut, for all the Italian clothes that you wear\nOr German cars that you drive\nOr french Champagne that we buy\nWe'll still be monkeys in their eyes\nSo why you are beggin' it\nWho knows, Italians fight to wear Jamaican clothes?\nItalians call their own women hoes?\nFor everyone's entertainment bro?\nBut hey, what do I know\nI'm just the one with the coldest flows\nAll over the globe baddin' down shows\nBut still don't oil my chest and pose\nPose a threat to the power structure\nNever cause' were anything special\nBut because were the people together\nAnd thats the only way things changin'.

   "lyrics": "Fire In The Booth Part 3 LyricsWhoever's more human must have the right to do the abusing\nI imagine that means you then\nOr are you men just as clueless\nFoolish fools, thoughts of a tortured soul\nBought for a quarter of gold\nOne little sand nigga slaughter it whole\nWhy not? They don't have souls\nThey love their children less than we do so they are less than equal\nThey abuse women so we kill them cos they are bloody villains\nThat's right, we are the feminists\nFor the women of the world, kill terrorists\nLiberate them from their burqas\nThey feel more free with their children murdered\nI know that it sounds absurd but lemme explain it a little bit further\nWe're so superior our missiles whistle until they tickle\nLittle itty bitty grandchildren and make them giggle\nBut their laughter sounds like screaming I told you that they were demons\nThey pretend to be dead to make us feel sad\nPut bullets in their head to make us feel bad\nBut we're never anything other than glad\nWhen those that look funny end up in a body bag\nBut if a hair is harmed on Sally or Brad or\nEven a dog we cry like mad\nA dog is a man's best friend, not a girl\nWomen are abused all over the world and children are raped\nEvery place, every religion or creed or race\nEven fathers with daughters, uncles with nieces sweep it under the carpet\nRape is a weapon used by power, and we don't wanna look like bastards\nSo manufacture hero complex, a reaction to nuttin' more complex\nTo organise mass rape in a state, don't wanna hear about mass graves\nCos I hate to relate to a shade that's darker than you\nOne that prays under a different roof\nHas less dollars or pounds, crowns or gowns or crowns\nFill 'em up with rounds\nIf they mess with the way that things are constructed\nObstructing lines of production\nYou can buy anything, liposuction, seduction, just buy it from us, men\n\nBuy lies, can't buy truth\nNo-one's selling it there is no use\nThere is no customer base for the product\nWe'd rather buy some celebrity trollop\nCos our life is about getting one-up\nOn everybody else that we pass on a come up\nWe don't care what force bring the sun up\nBut lie in the sun every day gettin' bun up\nLie to the point that it's part of the culture\nTell the truth it's only the result of\nA double lie\nCancelling itself, their pride cancer in itself\nCos virus is normality living in a world that is built on vanity\nMore salaries, more calories, more thieving, more charities\nPicture a Moor on a horse with a chariot speaking some kind of African Arabic\nTeaching mathematics with Spaniard when maths had not got to Britannia\nCan you picture mind scripture\nThats designed for the mind to enrich you\nAre you blind can't you find the riddim pratt?\nCause your timing alignment is on crack\nIt's hard to be as far off the rhythm as you are, it's like art\nHard to have so little charisma, I swear that you try to be shit\nTo make me look even better than\nEverybody knows that I am already\nI'm a pedigree that can't be touched like leprosy\nHave a rapper like The Beatles begging me to let it be\nAnd I don't need no referee\nI play the game on my own, it's my own sport\nAnd you can't take a king to his own court\nYou can't take a king to his own court\nYou ain't the throne sort\nYou're the type to rap for five minutes\nAnd complain your throat's sore\nWhile I'm so sure that my stone jaw\nIs the coldest on road since '04\nBut these silly little boys think their so raw\nMake a bigger bit a noise but we know you're\nYou might also likeYou ain't up the game, you ain't match fit\nYou ain't even got the brain for the tactics\nYou ain't even on the bench you're a ballboy\nOne lickle send out yout so just sit down\nI am the Big Mic man with the crown\nSuper cat de pon sting with the sound\nWho are these silly little\nWollies?\nThink they erupt with enough of the guts to be on it\nTheir the version of me that I didn't wanna be\nI'm the coldest I wrote since Admiral Zheng He\nI'm the fire in the booth, you a wet rag\nYou ain't the real ting like a step-dad\nI'm the best so rest where the rest have\nDon't big up your chest, let your breasts sag\nI'm the best dad look, I don't even beat my sons\nI let them shine\nEven when they got no talent to rhyme\nInsist on doing it all of the time\nAll of my spine is re-enforced with a kind\nOf carbon that hardens the thoughts in my mind\nOf course you will find that I torture a line\nI'm born with bars, no-one ever taught me to rhyme\nThe portion that's mine, don't touch it\nFurthermore, don't even discuss it\nI know that you heard\nBritain's biggest export is weapons of death\nThat ain't a theory or a guess\nTake another breath and your country is next\nUnless you remind 'em whenever you're rhyming\nYou're a beast on the mic with impeccable timing\nThey will think you're in the league that I'm in\nBut that is most absurd\n\nI Turn a Stanza to a cancer with banter\nFor those between the gangster and a panther\nI know you seen me these man dem with their tantrums\nLike kids when I'm off on a tandem\nCos they don't know what a tandem means\nSo rather than use a dictionary they talk shit and badmouth me\nWhen I'm only tryina elevate your mind, G\nBut I don't watch that the love is more than a grands worth\nYou should see when I roll through Handsworth\nElders see me, cross the road, talk to me and it usually goes\nWe love how you bus up da ting, spread knowledge\nBunfire pon them Babylon college\nWe salute you, you're the future\nAll the bigger man have time for them yout deh\nWhat I'm saying it that the respect's worth\nMore than the chain on your neck\nWhen it's not that it's somebody's mum\nSaying that she feed me to her son\nCos she wanna come get his mind out of the slums\nAkala is smarter than Arthur your dumb\nRegardless the bars are retiredly dumb\nWhat the raises and the raated a part of my lung\n\nTake out a whole clique that chat's do do\nPic up a mic, we can see who's who\nI'm fire in the booth, you dry wood\nYour flesh best taste quite good\nSo smart but he still move quite hood\nSee him on the road but don't think that I try should\nThat's a wise assessment, kind of like land is a wise investment\nEspecially land that's recently blessed with\nIn excess of one million deaths in\nAnd the castle you rest in, that's a next ting\nBuilt on the bones and the flesh of the wretched\nThrone that you pose in, only protected\nCos we regret that only deceptive\nThings that we like, and only reject it\nWhen it feels like it's truth were digesting\nSo\nGet in with a blessed king\nWhose crown is the rounds that he fought\nTherefore you ain't gotta deal with the fraud\nOf all these picanees of whom I'm bored\n\nMy worst, stronger than their best\nAura alone stronger than their flesh\nAll that they known can't compare to his guess\nUsually don't ever dare to spit next\nIt's clear the reason is fear\nEven the worst MC has ears\nBut we can't hear where the beat is\nThe time is his flow with the kick and the snare\nWhen they hear me they know life ain't fair\nGod bless some and some get air\nLike these conscious heads that cry\nThat I get big headed and I don't know why\nCos I, I have always been this guy\nEver since mum sent for the sky\nI decided that that was too low\nSo I'm astral travelling to another zone\nYou won't ever get on the dog and the bone\nCos I don't ever really wanna answer my phone\nZone that I'm in is high vibration\nSee the future with mind meditation\nYour peeps, poor libation\nFor all the peeps that get above their station\nI place them in the right placement\nThat is to say I erase them\n\nAin't no-one above nor adjacent\nStill these mugs they want to get feisty\nBut face it they don't really wanna face me\nI don't run so you can't ever chase me\nAnd I been through tings on the pavement\nBut don't beg road fame cos I never made it\nMy uncles, cousins and friends have done everything that yours have mate\nBut I don't tell their story I tell mine\nThat means I'm real and you're fake\nThat said, I don't mind a bit of fiction\nIf you did tell your story well\nBut your raps are dryer than a dead man's top lip\nAfter six years of living in hell\nYou meet a nice girl, you just might gel\nMight be wifey, you can't quite tell\nYou know why? Cos the only bitch in the world\nIs a man and his ego he hides in a shell\nMine is harder than my uncles foot back\nWho don't even need to wear shoes\n\nWho only eats pounded yam and stew\nWith hands like a can on a man, I refuse\nWho said mum never raised no fools, your mum raised you\nYou're a plonker, a plank, a donut, a tool\nYou make me think that mother nature's cruel\nThen I get back and remember\nLife is a gift even when it don't look like it is\nAnd everybody thinks that they're cold in a booth\nGot no friends to show them the truth\nPut the pen down, become a spectator\nGo get a day job, there is no shame in it\nWe need doctors and architects\nNot more crap rappers that are passed their best\nAnd if the cap fits you wear it\nIf it fits your friend too share it\nI know it ain't the role of a parent\nTo take my child's confidence and tear it\nBut it is my role as a father\nTo show my son about life and it's harder\n\nWhen you got a dad named Akala\nThose are big shoes to fill, be your own man\nHave you own plan, your own destiny\nJust don't ever mess with me\nPreferably bun these fools for their treachery\nDefinitely those that put us in jeopardy\nEspecially foes that wanna pose next to me\nNobody ain't testing me\nIt's the versatility that is killing them\nSo road but I teach kids William\nListen to my albums I actually write songs\nAnd of course the bars are brilliant\nWe can do politics, spirituality\nOr real life road reality\nOr do this ting here with straight up vanity\nEither way, nobody can't battle me\nMuch less shackle me, the maroon\nOne man army, an entire platoon\nThey're like \"won't he run out of breath soon?\"\n\"How does he do that? Is he human?\"\n\nLook man, it's the spirit of boukman\nBack in the flesh in a terrible crook man\nThe law won't like me, ain't it obvious\nI ain't a paedophile, now a colonist\nI'm the MC that you don't wanna bother with\nTo gauntlet is thrown down, who's crossing it\nHmm, that's what I thought\nYou can have your whole life to retort\nStill won't think up the things that I thought\nWhen I was age four\nStrach that before I was born\nIn the womb when I was yet to be formed\nBefore that in a past incarnation\nWhen I set fire to a thieves plantation\nMe and Sam Sharpe hid in the cane fields\nTwo weeks straight totally stayed still\nWith nothing but a blade of great steel\nJumped on our enemies what a great kill\nSelf defence is not violence it's common sense\nThe first rule of nature, self preservation\nTo let people kill and abuse you is just self hatred\nTurn the other cheek, why?\nNo-one ever got their freedom that way, lies\nWhen the oppressed say an eye for an eye\nThey talk this crap about the world goes blind\nJust don't attack us in the first place\nAnd everything will be just fine\nIn the mean time train hard\nRead nuff, stay sharp\nAnd don't diss the sisters, are you barmy?\nYou are putting down half your army\n\nAny evolution without the women in the middle is no revolution at all\nTrust me you could be back through them all\nWomen were there ready to pop tools\nBut we have become so cowardly that\nRather than fight back we attack\nThe only ones that ever had our back\nAnd that is a actual fact\nAnd I ain't saying that I ain't ever done that\nI'm just saying that it's time that we bun that\nSo don't put my name in the same sentence\nAs real revolutionaries, I'm offended\nReal revolutionaries spend their life engaged in revolutionary acts\nAnd as cold as I am on the mic\nThus far, I just rap\n\nThat said there is no comparison\nTo cold for the way that I carry on\nThese vultures feed off carrion\nCome along now, carry on, carry on\nRoll up roll up, two for a pound\nBun down MC's bun whole sound\nBun your whole clique I bun the whole town\nTake a stroll at the speed of sound\nWho said the speed of light was the fastest thing\nNever knew the speed of darkness\nA black hole absorbs all light that there is\nSo how could light ever get past it?\nI studied the masters and sages\nSecret teachings of all of the ages\nI don't know, I can't explain it\nThe knowledge ain't mine yet I radiate it\nIt's why they write sixteen lines\nAnd I write an essay that rhymes\nAnd I never went uni neither\nBut my mind works just fine\n\nIn fact no need to be modest\nMy mind's a fine instrument If I'm honest\nAnd I promise that I'll show you where the bodies at\nBurying MC's my lickle hobby that\nAnd MC's don't bite me\nThey ain't got the technique to even copy that\nI think I made my point\nIn a manner that is more than adequate\nLet's put all the boasting aside\nI do know that I'm just channeling\nThis thing, what is it?\nInspiration, the source of the spirit?\nNot a man in the sky\nBut a force that animates all things that are living\nDali's brush, Akala's lyrics all things\nAin't explained by the laws of physics\nCos you've been down on your life\nDon't mean you'll ever be on top of it\nCos for this force right here\nThere ain't one that is equal and opposite6Embed"

But when your skin is white\nDifferent set of rules you can abide by\nDark suffering is not humanized\nNo surprise, we still see ourselves through their eyes\nDarkies became legally human\nDuring the course of our parents life\nAnd the freedoms we have only occurred\nCos our ancestors spilled their blood to the earth\nThey changed that much? Are you so sure?\nThe world's darker people still the most poor?\nSo it's our task to put an end to this\nEven those like me with our heritage mixed\nIf a knife is in your back 9 inches\nAnd it's only been pulled out six\nWhen the wound starts healing\nAnd we stop bleeding and bleaching\nCan it begin to fix?\nWhen the plague of self hate\nIs no longer a weight so great\nPush you to kill one another\nWhen we put a stop to false charity\nThat gives with one hand and bombs with the other\nWhen the IMF and World Bank, along with their puppets\nNo longer strangle our nations\nWhen the invaders don't have military bases\nIn so many places\nWhen the jail cells are not packed with black backs\nAnd the gats and the crack are no longer factors\nWhen we celebrate true self-determination\nNot a few token bit part actors\nWhen the truth is told and there is\nThe dignity to remember the dead\nBecause as long as they are distorting the past\nIt means they have the intention of doing it again\n[Hook] x213Embed"

Indian people\nWho owns our shit?\nSo we shake our arse and dance\nAs if racism just upped and vanished\nBut has it? No its right on course\nYou\u2019re beaten so bad, you\u2019re trained to ignore\nLet me not just make sweeping statements\nGimme a second, I\u2019ll explain it\nFor small amounts of drug possession there\u2019s more black people in jail in America than there is for rape and armed robbery and murder all put together\nYou can say they\u2019re just locking up thugs\nImagine if they locked up every middle class kid that had ever held drugs\nOh that\u2019s right, that\u2019d be your kids!\nBigger than that what is going on with this\nPrison in America\u2019s a private business\nThey get paid 50k per year per inmate by the State, just wait\u2026\nAlso legally are allowed to use their prison inmates as slaves\nCheap slave labour, big corporations\nThey come out of jail, can\u2019t get a job\nSo when we celebrate going to jail\nWe are LITERALLY CELEBRATING ENSLAVEMENT\nAdd to that, that the hood that you\u2019re livin\u2019\nEngineered social condition that breeds crime by design\nWhere do you think you get your nine?\nYou can say that they\u2019re just black\nBut I like to deal with facts\nIn the 1920s you would\u2019ve found in America\nBlack towns\nProspering centres of economics and education to make you proud\nBut some people couldn\u2019t bear that the former slaves would not just lie down\nSo the KKK and other hate groups burnt those towns to the ground\nKillin hundreds\nIf it ain\u2019t understood\nYou think you were always livin\u2019 in the hood?\nShit it\u2019s only been sixty years\nSince they hung blacks and burned em\u2019\nAnd that was so cool\nDay reel passes, picnic baskets\nEven gave kids the day off school\nTo go see a lynchin\u2019\nHave a picnic\nIt\u2019s fun to watch the little monkeys die\nThen people act a little dysfunctional\nYou wanna pretend that you don\u2019t know why\nIf your colour means you can be killed\nAnd you\u2019re powerless to get justice about it\nIs it difficult to figure out how you would then end up feelin\u2019 about it?\nAnd that ain\u2019t excuses\nJust dealing with the roots of abuses that make a reality\nWhere a generation of young men speak of ourselves as dirt casually\nThat\u2019s America\nThis Britain\nSome things are similar\nSome different\nIn this country the first enslaved were the working class\nWhat\u2019s changed?\nWorse jobs, worse conditions\nWorse taxes, look where you\u2019re livin\u2019\nYou go to the pub, Friday night\nYou will fight with a guy\nDon\u2019t know what for\nBut won\u2019t fight with a guy, suit and a tie\nWho sends your kids to die in a war\nThey don\u2019t send the kids of the richer politicians\nIt\u2019s your kids, the poor British\nThat they send to go die in a foreign land\nFor these wars you don\u2019t understand\nYeah they say that you\u2019re British\nAnd that lovely patriotism they feed ya\nBut in reality you have more in common with immigrants\nThan with your leaders\nI know, both side of my family\nBlack and white are fed ghetto mentality\nReality in this system\nPoor people are dirt regardless of shade\nBut with that said\nLet\u2019s not pretend that everything is the same\nWhen our grandparents came here to Britain\nIf you had a criminal record you couldn\u2019t get in\nYet that ain\u2019t protect them from all the stupid, stupid abuses they would be livin\u2019\nKicked in the teeth\nStabbed in the street\nMany times fired bombed our houses\nPut faeces through our letter box\nAnd of course the cops did so much about it(!)\nDaily, up to the 80s\nPeople spittin\u2019 into my pram cos\u2019 I was a coon baby\nBut of course that has had no effect on why today we are crazy\nAnd none of this was for any good reason\nThey were just dark and breathing\nTo ease the guilt now for all of this treatment\nConstant stereotypes are needed\nSo if I celebrate how big that my dick is\nBricks that I\u2019m flippin\u2019\nClips that I\u2019m stickin\u2019\nChicks that I\u2019m hittin\u2019\nI\u2019m playing my position\nBut if I teach a kid to be a mathematician\nMessin\u2019 with the schism\nHow they gonna fill a prison when materialism is nothing but a religion?\nWhat do you think we got now in Britain?\nJust like America, private prisons\nPrisons for profit!\nThat mean when your kids go jail people make money off it\nSo keep environments that breed crime\nBuild more jails at the same time\nMarket badness to the kids in the rhymes\nAs long as rich kids ain\u2019t dying its fine!\nGet em\u2019 to the point where some are so lost\nThey actually believe that if they don\u2019t celebrate killin\u2019 themselves off\nThat it\u2019s because they\u2019re soft\nWas Malcolm soft?\nWas Marley soft?\nTell me was Marcus Garvey soft?\nWell? Was Mohammed Ali soft?\nNah, Nah I think not!\nBut they want us to think that the road is cool\nBeing on road is all we can do\nWe don\u2019t control the wholesale productions\nWho benefits from us movin\u2019 the food?\nOr thinking there\u2019s no way out of road life\nBut Malcolm X used to hustle out on the roadside\nWhen Marcus Garvey organised more than 6 million people\nWith no Facebook or Twitter\nWhy is this something you cannot equal?\nShiiiiit!\nOne of my homeboys did a ten straight in the box in yard\nNow what\u2019s he doing?\nPassin\u2019 his doctorate\nDon\u2019t tell me that it\u2019s too hard!\nWho trained you to believe that you\u2019re inferior?\nSungbo Eredo in Nigeria are the remains of an ancient moat\nDug 1000 years ago\n20 metres wide, 70 down\nRound the remains of an ancient town\nThat\u2019s 400 square miles around\n400 square miles around\nPlease, please don\u2019t believe me\nIt was a documentary on BBC!\nBut we ain\u2019t studyin\u2019 history\nToo busy watching MTV\nAnd MTV said wear platinum\nNow everybody wanna go and wear platinum\nAnd MTV said pop magnums\nNow everybody wanna go and pop magnums\nIf MTV said drink prune juice\nYou would start hearing that in tunes soon\n\u2018Hey! Today I wore my Cartier\nIs it now more important what I got to say?\u2019\nOh and I drive a Mercedes by the way\nSo everybody listen to what I got to say\nHuh, does that make you all happy?\nAhh but shit my head\u2019s still nappy\nThink for myself, still some mad at me\nBut on the mic ain\u2019t not one bad as me\nAll of this here\u2019s good for the rhymes\nPut us in the same place at the same time\nAnd it\u2019s clear to everybody that I\u2019m out of my mind\nSome of these guys are runnin\u2019 out of their rhymes\nClear to everybody that has got ears\nI\u2019m the guy that they just might fear\nThey wanna get near but they can\u2019t have a peer\nAh dear I\u2019m hard liquor you\u2019re just like beer\nFront on the kid for another five years\nCome to my shows and some cry tears\nIt mean that much to em\u2019, it\u2019s a movement!\nI don\u2019t speak for myself but a unit\nBlack, white, man, woman, anyone that respects truth we put in\nDudes are like no dinner with just puddin\u2019\nYeah you\u2019re sweet but no substance puddin\u2019\nYou could never ever be with a level on\nOur songs get out played out there in Lebanon\nWe speak for the people properly\nNot for the old fat guys in offices\nAnd the girls love him, it ain\u2019t fair\nHe can\u2019t even be bothered to comb his hair\nAnyway that\u2019s enough kissin\u2019 my own arse\nBack to the more important task of being so shower\nI got half the hood screaming \u201cKNOWLEDGE IS POWER\u201d\nAnd I ain\u2019t saying that will change rap\nBut I do know this for a fact\nRight now there\u2019s a yout\u2019 on your block\nWith his hands on his balls, face screwed up\nSwear he don\u2019t care, don\u2019t give a fuck\nThat he won\u2019t let nobody caught his block\nBut the words go in\nOpen up your chakra\nBecause once that\u2019s happened there\u2019s no going back\nOnce you start to see what is really happening\nWho the enemy you should be attackin\u2019 is\nSo READ, READ, READ!\nStuck on the block, READ, READ!\nSittin\u2019 in the box, READ, READ!\nDon\u2019t let them say what you can achieve\nCos when people are enslaved\nOne of the first things they do is stop them reading\nCos\u2019 it is well understood that intelligent people will take their freedom\nCos\u2019 if we knew our power we would understand that we can\u2019t be held down\nIf we knew our power, we would not elevate not one of these clowns\nIf we knew our power, we wouldn\u2019t get arrogant when we get two pennies\nIf we knew our power, we would see what everybody sees, that we\u2019re rich already!\nBut never mind MCs go run for your mummy\nI\u2019m hungry, I run for my tummy\nThat\u2019s enough, back to worshiping money\nI\u2019m off, back to the study!\n[Intro]\nYo, Akala\nKnowledge is power\nVolume 1, Mixtape 28th of may Listen\nAkala music.com\nTiny bit more vocal please actually\nListen, Knowledge is power always\nListen\n\n[Part 2]\nOi, Mate my personal life's great\nSome of you would love me more, If I rubbed that in you're face\nOkay, well\nLet us run down the resume and have a little chat about how Akala's living today\nBig whip, nice yard, Been all over the globe\nLook how many continents I have done, Shows\nCouple little company's, Neat little office\nEverything going swell, Little bit of profit\nBuilt a business educating kids from the blocks\nSo far as I'm concerned you gotta be a mug to not rate him\nOwn my masters, Still my own master\nNovels and scripts on the way\nRap is just a part of, The genius in his head\nAnd he knows it, Dickhead, Since I used to kick ball for West ham\nWith my bighead\nBack in school days wearing hand-me downs from my sister\nAnd gal' was still onto man, Now thats some ras charisma\nAs just a nippa, I took my first pull of Rizla\nAnd who you think gave me that? yeah my bigger sista\nSo when we speak of struggle cousin it's yours\nYou know the same old madness, working class poor\nYeah, So, may of won a couple awards\nBut I guarantee my family's just as messed up as yours\nAll the abuse and the alcoholism and drug addiction\nUncles going to prison\nThis is working class livin' in Britain, It ain't great\nYou gotta be kiddin'\nSo please don't ever get confused by me spittin'\nCos', yes I said the ghetto's in our head\nBut no I didn't mean that if you live next to a food yard that thats in your dreams\nI meant believing in the madness they spout about us\nIs far more dangerous than putting us in council houses\nSo yeah I criticize but from a place of love, never, ever\nBecause I think that I've become above\nEvery young broth, you wanna judge as a tug'\nIt's me minus a little guidance and love\nSo I think that your the mug\nAnd why be smug when it's an actual fact\nWe all commit crime, Simply by paying tax\nCos' we don't go and tickle the people in Iraq\nAnd ask them so politely for all their minerals we extract\nWe blew children's heads off, Set fire to backs\nWere a gangsta nation get down or you get clapped, so\nWhen you see the yout' running around on the road with heaters\nDon't be surprised, they're just copying their leaders\nLong as the wars stay in places that are brown and poor\nWe can all pretend to be Abhorred But we applaud\nIf you go up to Knightsbridge and get violent\nThe police man who duppies you will probably get knighted\nIf I don't wanna fight you cuz'\nIt ain't cos' I'm frightened\nIt's just rather fight with those who really think they're titans, shit\nI ain't scared of bleeding\nI ain't scared of breathing another breath in this world where everything is so uneven\nWhere millions murdered in the Congo and it's barely news\nBut if a footballers wife should buy a pair of shoes\nI'm supposed to give a fuck apparently, I do not\nThe worlds a reflection of you're block\nAnd if you think a world that profit from their death, and be totally cool\nAnd think you're better cos' you live here, your a bloody fool\nLook around the genocidal abuse\nI swear humanity ain't nothing but a virus with shoes\nThen I pick my nephew up from school, and I look at the youths\nAnd see the love that they show each other and I'm just so confused\nBecause they ain't learnt yet what is their race or religion\nSo we're put unconditioned but we learn to play our position\nIn the system\nLook what that does to our recognition of self\nWe grow suspicion of our own intuition, listen\nAkala's sick but he raps about racism to much\nCould you imagine I gave a flying f\nCos' it's amazing, how many wanna claim they love this music\nWith no respect for the actual struggle that produced it\nDid Hip-Hop not start in segregated hoods, are them hoods not still segregated?\nSo it's really good\nAnd the first nation not still on reservations where the age of 46\nIs the average life expectation\nAnd fellas, I wonder where the Favelas, could be suddenly knocked down\nAnd replaced with something better\nIf you got sense you see fights are joined in race class and\nGender are sides of the same coin\nSo, if you really down for justice whoever the people who suffered, whoever you are\nI consider you my sisters, brothers\nBut call it what it is like Carlin or Bill Hicks\nNot these patronizing left-wing little twits who ask me dumb shit\nOn the superior tip\nAnd wanna act like cos I read I saw less violence as a kid\nDon't make me an exception\nFor your mental protection\nFrom acceptin' the madness in the system we are left in\nThat was the clearest thing to come of august events\nAll the closet bigots started speaking their minds again\nSo when a Jamaican or Asians misbehavin' of course it's because of their skin\nBlonde hair kills a million people, thats just him\nAnd it's entertaining some people are so thick\nBut I prefer that to all of the fake grins\nCos' it's the only problem people claim they wanna solve but don't actually wanna talk about\nHow it evolved, You are told, this country really really yours sir?\nWhat they did to brown people they did to their own poor first\nAnd originally in the states, working class whites were also enslaved\nStill no one talks about it today\nEver since the master came with the system of privileged\nMade the working whites the overseers mulatto the house\nCos' put the darkest blacks in the field, that mind is with us still\nBillion dollar industry's, skin cream and bleaching pills\nAnd lets be honest most people of my complexion to this very day still think they're\nBetter than the darker section\nYou say it's changed then only educate me about Wilberforce not about the Africans in Haiti\nWho beat the army's of the British, Spanish and napoleon, From the moment it was stolen\nFrom em, There was no controllin' em\nWhen I was in school, she said no you never fought for freedom\nNo, we freed you and you were on your knees pleading\nAnd once more did you know that we kind of saved you from the barbarism of Africa\nYou should be grateful\nAnd enough of our own people can't be bothered to read\nThat they actually believe that we were swinging from trees\nThey don't know the kingdom of Congo had embassy's in Italy\n500 years ago, Literally\nAin't heard of Saint Maurice or Septimius Severus\nThey ain't studying the past cos' they think it's irrelevant\nAnd attempts of pretending ancient Egyptians weren't African\nNuttin' more than pseudo intellectual lies\nThey obviously ain't read what Aristotle and Herodotus said\nAbout people they saw for their own eyes and\nEgypt's been invaded since the fall of the pharaoh's\nNot once, Not twice, But many many times\nAnd nobody wants to explain why so many statues are missin' noses\nEven when those statues made of granite\nIt ain't one people alone, mis-taught about themselves\nWe live on Celtic land, But don't learn about the Celts\nThe same, Irish people you characterize as stupid\nDuring the dark ages some of the most educated living in Europe\nAnd did you learn the numbers you count with every day\nWere invented by Indian people, I bet you didn't\nOr how many million Indians fought for Britain in both world wars\nStill you got the cheek to call them immigrants\nWe don't learn about the Moors of course, for some that knowledge dangerous\nIs it a problem the impact they had on the Renaissance?\nWhen people take power over another group\nWe minimize their achievements so we can make it feel true\nSo if you think Columbus was first to sail ocean blue\nYou probably believe Elvis invented Rock & Roll too\nAnd oh, for the record no doubt I believe in peace\nBut not for one second will I turn the other cheek\nThey slap you, slap them back and take teeth\nThe only way a bully ever learn is getting beat\nFight, fire with fire nah fire with water\nSee the life you enforce is stronger than the destroyer\nThat's why these MC's can't speak to me\nNO, All men are not made equally\nMy brains made of iron fiber, conductin' the livest wire\nMy average grades higher than Oxford and Cambridge require\nI don't want credit, because I got a message\nI want credit cos' I'm the best MC\nDead it\nWhen I came out way back in 04\nSister had just won every award\nMost man would have done the bait thing\nPut big sis on the chorus chords\nThat would of been a-list sure\nQuickly I would of been famous more\nBut look how I came in this ting' raw\nBang of the streets and more\nIf I MC'd and I heard me rap i'd be like what the\nI ain't never gonna' be that good so\nI better not push my luck\nIt will embarrass me\nOnly insanity, Would make you challenge me\nBetter hope if we bump heads, that day that I fee like charity\nIf not it's a beating and ain't no use in searching for meaning\nCuz all it means is that you are crap and I am a genius\nWait I'm Panama I'll push the parameter\nCan you imagine a Pharaoh more sicker than average\nI'll kill them with character\nBenjamin Banneker\nLook at the marriage of stamina\nDamage ya\nBoy from Britannica\nGot love from the whole in the calendar, so cold that I roll in a Challenger\nWhile you men roll with the amateurs\nI'm too much harder\nYou can just call him Father Akala\nBut I don't talk shit like a pastor\nMany know that I'm smarter than Arthur\nBloody disaster\nFire astarter\nProbably prodigy\nMake you a martyr\nFor these crap MC's that mumble\nThen see me in the flesh and crumble\nWhoever told you that I was humble\nNo I'm not, Don't lie\nI'm so sure with my writing ability\nThat I feel like I'm finding divinity\nSit down and every rhyme a soliloquy\nMy agility, timing is Military\nWhat scene? get a Guillotine for the Mini-me\nIt seems ya'll fiend for the the mimicry\nYour team couldn't dream of this synygy\nThat I be when I scheme on a wicked beat\nThere he goes again with the big words, bare syllables\nGet your dictionaries out\nThat's what I'm about\nClowns wanna shout\nThrash him, smash him in the mouth\nBloody professor\nMan of the letter\nI've read and I've read and I'm sure that I'm better\nNever regretting the endeavor to dead an oppressor\nI think that they're lepers that think that their pleasures are better endeavors\nDon't know about precious but\nSee me? born in a rage\nMaroon blood, coursing my veins\nAs you can see I was born for the stage\nBut, I'll never be their cultural maid\nSome say that we're political\nCos' what they're doing isn't\nDon't they preach a political doctrine called materialism\nBut, for all the Italian clothes that you wear\nOr German cars that you drive\nOr french Champagne that we buy\nWe'll still be monkeys in their eyes\nSo why you are beggin' it\nWho knows, Italians fight to wear Jamaican clothes?\nItalians call their own women hoes?\nFor everyone's entertainment bro?\nBut hey, what do I know\nI'm just the one with the coldest flows\nAll over the globe baddin' down shows\nBut still don't oil my chest and pose\nPose a threat to the power structure\nNot because we're anything special\nBut because were the people together\nAnd that's the only way things changin'. EVER\nYou might also like[Hook] x2\nAbsolute power corrupts absolutely\nBut absolute powerlessness does the same\nIt's not the poverty\nIt's the inequality we live in everyday that will turn us insane\nWe live in everyday\nYo, Listen\n\nIn a scheme of livin' my life wasn't hard\nBut as far as Britain goes sh't i practically starved\nSleepin' in a track suit, gas meter runnin' out\nElectric cut of as well, candles lighting up the house\nLookin' in my mother's eyes I see how she feels\nThe strain and the pain of just paying bills\nIt ain't real and that's how i grow like so many more\nAnd i was part of who i am\nI am very sure\nYou wanna' know the rage i feel in my stomach\nKnowing my mom and dad split up when i was still in her stomach\nAnd not everything that happened i will put in 16's\nBut i will tell you enough so you know what i mean\nMy boy's mother got cancer the same time as mine\nBut his mother died and mine survived\nIt was crazy back then\nWhen i was like 10 already had the mental strength\nMore than many grown men\nIt was a couple of years after my step dad left\nDid he really know all the crazy mess he left\nBecause mum done recovered from the lumps in her neck\nBut being poor and alone couldn't cope with the stress\nHer and my big sis for\nSo much so, that I hadn\u2019t left school\nWhen she left home\nI was 13 by now still a little kid, innocent\nNext couple year though would turn 'to a militant\nThat is the result of no food in the fridge\nAnd every other day you gettin' searched by the pig's\nPlus these patronizing teacher doe' my grade sick\nTrying to emasculate me yeah turn me into a f'cking ana\nDon't mean no woman please let me be clear\nI mean been a spineless man because what do they fear\nMore than the working class brown male with a brain\nAnd when our energy is harness everything changed\nLook at 'Pac, look a Marley, look at Hendrix, look at Garvey\nThis is the potential that is wasted on a daily basis\nA racist classist world that we live in\nStill we comin' from nothing and we educating millions\nI see why it scares you its like how dare you\nOvercoming the obstacle that we have been careful to\nPlace in your way, every step of the way\nIn this so called democracy were kids get sprayed\nBlack and the Asians, Turks and the Chavs\nCrowded in council flats, living like ants\nAnd who's more confused than so called white trash\nTalking this madness about they want there country back\nIt never was yours, you should read more\nWhat they did brown people they did to the own poor\nBut people's memory short so much that i'm seeing\nBlack and Asian kids cast eastern-European\nNo pot to piss in, makes competition\nI fail to see how this is a effective system\nWhen cats and dogs in America and Britain\nEat better food than most of humanity\nAnd we spend our technology only on killing\nHow is this more than sophisticated savagery\nIt was once said the world is a stage\nEach persons is just a actor with a part to play\nLike the middle class kids and the kids of the rich\nThat have everything but yet still pissed and on coke and ketamine strong hat on\nI ain't generalizing look at the evidence\nSo go to Glastonbury any year\nYou will see but unlike carnival it won't be crowing with police\nThis is London the kids on the very next street\nHad a very different life experience from me\nAnd in my experience the can't help but be smug\nAfter lifetime of what they think is just good luck\nBut still more anxious and more thankless\nUnearned privileges ways like an anchor\nIt's why they copy what we do, tyna' be what they not\nThey will grow up though and get better jobs\nAnd maintain the system that they claim they hated\nThey can't fight against it, they got a stake in this matrix\nHip-Hop is just a fad to them, you didn't know\nBut for us this is our living breathing soul\nAnd yeah they might back pack in South America\nOr even volunteer in a African Village\nBut all said and done, when push come to shove\nAnd shit hits the fan they're middle class and British and i ain't even dissing\nThat's just how it is most rich brown people just as full of sh't\nSo much more concerned with our cars and jewels\nThat most of the world poor luck just like you\nSo much more concerned being privileged few\nAnd who knows maybe me to\n[Hook]\n\nKnowledge is Power!!!!!\n\n[Part 3]\n\nWhoever's more human must have the right to do the abusing\nI imagine that means you then\nOr are you men just as clueless\nFoolish fools, thoughts of a tortured soul\nBought for a quarter of gold\nOne little sand nigga slaughter it whole\nWhy not? They don't have souls\nThey love their children less than we do so they are less than equal\nThey abuse women so we kill them cos they are bloody villains\nThat's right, we are the feminists\nFor the women of the world, kill terrorists\nLiberate them from their burqas\nThey feel more free with their children murdered\nI know that it sounds absurd but lemme explain it a little bit further\nWe're so superior our missiles whistle until they tickle\nLittle itty bitty grandchildren and make them giggle\nBut their laughter sounds like screaming I told you that they were demons\n\nThey pretend to be dead to make us feel sad\nPut bullets in their head to make us look bad\nBut we're never anything other than glad\nWhen those that look funny end up in a body bag\nBut if a hair is harmed on Sally or Brad or\nEven a dog we cry like mad\nA dog is a man's best friend, not a girl\nWomen are abused all over the world and children are raped\nEvery place, every religion or creed or race\nEven fathers with daughters, uncles with nieces sweep it under the carpet\nRape is a weapon used by power, and we don't wanna look like bastards\nSo manufacture hero complex, a reaction to nuttin' more complex\nTo organise mass rape of the state, don't wanna hear about mass graves\nCos I hate to relate to a shade that's darker than you\nOne that prays under a different roof\nHas less dollars or pounds, crowns or gowns or crowns\nFill 'em up with rounds\nIf they mess with the way that things are constructed\nObstructing lines of production\nYou can buy anything, liposuction, seduction, just buy it from us, men\n\nBuy lies, can't buy truth\nNo-one's selling it there is no use\nThere is no customer base for the product\nWe'd rather buy some celebrity trollop\nCos our life is about getting one-up\nOn everybody else that we pass on a come up\nWe don't care what force bring the sun up\nBut lie in the sun every day gettin' bun up\nLie to the point that it's part of the culture\nTell the truth it's only the result of\nA double lie\nCancelling itself, their pride cancer in itself\nCos virus is normality living in a world that is built on vanity\nMore salaries, more calories, more thieving, more charities\nPicture a Moor on a horse with a chariot speaking some kind of African Arabic\nTeaching mathematics with Spaniard when maths had not got to Britannia\nCan you picture mind scripture\nThats designed for the mind to enrich you\nAre you blind can't you find the riddim pratt?\nCause your timing alignment is on crack\nIt's hard to be as far off the rhythm as you are, it's like art\nHard to have so little charisma, I swear that you try to be shit\nTo make me look even better than\nEverybody knows that I am already\nI'm a pedigree that can't be touched like leprosy\nHave a rapper like The Beatles begging me to let it be\nAnd I don't need no referee\nI play the game on my own, it's my own sport\nAnd you can't take a king to his own court\nYou can't take a king to his own court\nYou ain't the throne sort\nYou're the type to rap for five minutes\nAnd complain your throat's sore\nWhile I'm so sure that my stone jaw\nIs the coldest on road since '04\nBut these silly little boys think their so raw\nMake a bigger bit a noise but we know you're\n\nYou ain't up the game, you ain't match fit\nYou ain't even got the brain for the tactics\nYou ain't even on the bench you're a ballboy\nOne lickle send out yout so just sit down\nI am the Big Mic man with the crown\nSuper cat de pon sting with the sound\nWho are these silly little\nWollies?\nThink they erupt with enough of the guts to be on it\nTheir the version of me that I didn't wanna be\nI'm the coldest I wrote since Admiral Zheng He\nI'm the fire in the booth, you a wet rag\nYou ain't the real ting like a step-dad\nI'm the best so rest where the rest have\nDon't big up your chest, let your breasts sag\nI'm the best dad look, I don't even beat my sons\nI let them shine\nEven when they got no talent to rhyme\nInsist on doing it all of the time\nAll of my spine is re-enforced with a kind\nOf carbon that hardens the thoughts in my mind\nOf course you will find that I torture a line\nI'm born with bars, no-one ever taught me to rhyme\nThe portion that's mine, don't touch it\nFurthermore, don't even discuss it\nI know that you heard\n\nBritain's biggest export is weapons of death\nThat ain't a theory or a guess\nTake another breath and your country is next\nUnless you remind 'em whenever you're rhyming\nYou're a beast on the mic with impeccable timing\nThey will think you're in the league that I'm in\nBut that is most absurd\n\nI Turn a Stanza to a cancer with banter\nFor those between the gangster and a panther\nI know you seen me these man dem with their tantrums\nLike kids when I'm off on a tandem\nCos they don't know what a tandem means\nSo rather than use a dictionary they talk shit and badmouth me\nWhen I'm only tryina elevate your mind, G\nBut I don't watch that the love is more than a grands worth\nYou should see when I roll through Handsworth\nElders see me, cross the road, talk to me and it usually goes\nWe love how you bus up da ting, spread knowledge\nBunfire pon them Babylon college\nWe salute you, you're the future\nAll the bigger man have time for them yout deh\nWhat I'm saying it that the respect's worth\nMore than the chain on your neck\nWhen it's not that it's somebody's mum\nSaying that she feed me to her son\nCos she wanna come get his mind out of the slums\nAkala is smarter than Arthur your dumb\nRegardless the bars are retiredly dumb\nWhat the raises and the raated a part of my lung\n\nTake out a whole clique that chat's do do\nPic up a mic, we can see who's who\nI'm fire in the booth, you dry wood\nYour flesh best taste quite good\nSo smart but he still move quite hood\nSee him on the road but don't think that I try should\nThat's a wise assessment, kind of like land is a wise investment\nEspecially land that's recently blessed with\nIn excess of one million deaths in\nAnd the castle you rest in, that's a next ting\nBuilt on the bones and the flesh of the wretched\nThrone that you pose in, only protected\nCos we regret that only deceptive\nThings that we like, and only reject it\nWhen it feels like it's truth were digesting\nSo\nGet in with a blessed king\nWhose crown is the rounds that he fought\nTherefore you ain't gotta deal with the fraud\nOf all these picanees of whom I'm bored\n\nMy worst, stronger than their best\nAura alone stronger than their flesh\nAll that they known can't compare to his guess\nUsually don't ever dare to spit next\nIt's clear the reason is fear\nEven the worst MC has ears\nBut we can't hear where the beat is\nThe time is his flow with the kick and the snare\nWhen they hear me they know life ain't fair\nGod bless some and some get air\nLike these conscious heads that cry\nThat I get big headed and I don't know why\nCos I, I have always been this guy\nEver since mum sent for the sky\nI decided that that was too low\nSo I'm astral travelling to another zone\nYou won't ever get on the dog and the bone\nCos I don't ever really wanna answer my phone\nZone that I'm in is high vibration\nSee the future with mind meditation\nYour peeps, poor libation\nFor all the peeps that get above their station\nI place them in the right placement\nThat is to say I erase them\n\nAin't no-one above nor adjacent\nStill these mugs they want to get feisty\nBut face it they don't really wanna face me\nI don't run so you can't ever chase me\nAnd I been through tings on the pavement\nBut don't beg road fame cos I never made it\nMy uncles, cousins and friends have done everything that yours have mate\nBut I don't tell their story I tell mine\nThat means I'm real and you're fake\nThat said, I don't mind a bit of fiction\nIf you did tell your story well\nBut your raps are dryer than a dead man's top lip\nAfter six years of living in hell\nYou meet a nice girl, you just might gel\nMight be wifey, you can't quite tell\nYou know why? Cos the only bitch in the world\nIs a man and his ego he hides in a shell\nMine is harder than my uncles foot back\nWho don't even need to wear shoes\n\nWho only eats pounded yam and stew\nWith hands like a can on a man, I refuse\nWho said mum never raised no fools, your mum raised you\nYou're a plonker, a plank, a donut, a tool\nYou make me think that mother nature's cruel\nThen I get back and remember\nLife is a gift even when it don't look like it is\nAnd everybody thinks that they're cold in a booth\nGot no friends to show them the truth\nPut the pen down, become a spectator\nGo get a day job, there is no shame in it\nWe need doctors and architects\nNot more crap rappers that are passed their best\nAnd if the cap fits you wear it\nIf it fits your friend too share it\nI know it ain't the role of a parent\nTo take my child's confidence and tear it\nBut it is my role as a father\nTo show my son about life and it's harder\n\nWhen you got a dad named Akala\nThose are big shoes to fill, be your own man\nHave you own plan, your own destiny\nJust don't ever mess with me\nPreferably bun these fools for their treachery\nDefinitely those that put us in jeopardy\nEspecially foes that wanna pose next to me\nNobody ain't testing me\nIt's the versatility that is killing them\nSo road but I teach kids William\nListen to my albums I actually write songs\nAnd of course the bars are brilliant\nWe can do politics, spirituality\nOr real life road reality\nOr do this ting here with straight up vanity\nEither way, nobody can't battle me\nMuch less shackle me, the maroon\nOne man army, an entire platoon\nThey're like \"won't he run out of breath soon?\"\n\"How does he do that? Is he human?\"\n\nLook man, it's the spirit of boukman\nBack in the flesh in a terrible crook man\nThe law won't like me, ain't it obvious\nI ain't a paedophile, now a colonist\nI'm the MC that you don't wanna bother with\nTo gauntlet is thrown down, who's crossing it\nHmm, that's what I thought\nYou can have your whole life to retort\nStill won't think up the things that I thought\nWhen I was age four\nStrach that before I was born\nIn the womb when I was yet to be formed\nBefore that in a past incarnation\nWhen I set fire to a thieves plantation\nMe and Sam Sharpe hid in the cane fields\nTwo weeks straight totally stayed still\n\nWith nothing but a blade of great steel\nJumped on our enemies what a great kill\nSelf defence is not violence it's common sense\nThe first rule of nature, self preservation\nTo let people kill and abuse you is just self hatred\nTurn the other cheek, why?\nNo-one ever got their freedom that way, lies\nWhen the oppressed say an eye for an eye\nThey talk this crap about the world goes blind\nJust don't attack us in the first place\nAnd everything will be just fine\nIn the mean time train hard\nRead nuff, stay sharp\nAnd don't diss the sisters, are you barmy?\nYou are putting down half your army\n\nAny evolution without the women in the middle is no revolution at all\nTrust me you could be back through them all\nWomen were there ready to pop tools\nBut we have become so cowardly that\nRather than fight back we attack\nThe only ones that ever had our back\nAnd that is a actual fact\nAnd I ain't saying that I ain't ever done that\nI'm just saying that it's time that we bun that\nSo don't put my name in the same sentence\nAs real revolutionaries, I'm offended\nReal revolutionaries spend their life engaged in revolutionary acts\nAnd as cold as I am on the mic\nThus far, I just rap\n\nThat said there is no comparison\nTo cold for the way that I carry on\nThese vultures feed off carrion\nCome along now, carry on, carry on\nRoll up roll up, two for a pound\nBun down MC's bun whole sound\nBun your whole clique I bun the whole town\nTake a stroll at the speed of sound\nWho said the speed of light was the fastest thing\nNever knew the speed of darkness\nA black hole absorbs all light that there is\nSo how could light ever get past it?\nI studied the masters and sages\nSecret teachings of all of the ages\nI don't know, I can't explain it\nThe knowledge ain't mine yet I radiate it\nIt's why they write sixteen lines\nAnd I write an essay that rhymes\nAnd I never went uni neither\nBut my mind works just fine\n\nIn fact no need to be modest\nMy mind's a fine instrument If I'm honest\nAnd I promise that I'll show you where the bodies at\nBurying MC's my lickle hobby that\nAnd MC's don't bite me\nThey ain't got the technique to even copy that\nI think I made my point\nIn a manner that is more than adequate\nLet's put all the boasting aside\nI do know that I'm just channeling\nThis thing, what is it?\nInspiration, the source of the spirit?\nNot a man in the sky\nBut a force that animates all things that are living\nDali's brush, Akala's lyrics all things\nAin't explained by the laws of physics\nCos you've been down on your life\nDon't mean you'll ever be on top of it\nCos for this force right here\nThere ain't one that is equal and oppositeEmbed"

It don't matter, they can't make change\nNew driver but we got no brakes\nWhatever the place, whatever the face\nThe master never ever frees his slave\nThey always knew it, so they pursue it\nBut we've been too divided to ever be guided through it\nGotta stop 'em because they're rotten from the days of picking cotton\nTo sell us a love song and we're so besotted\nSo confused, we believe their promise\nBut there are some that lead more honest\nThey are not forgotten, though they shot 'em\nSo scream to the top of your lungs right from the bottom!\nYou might also likeMalcolm said it, Martin said it\nMarley said it, Ali said it\nGarvey said it, Toussaint said it\nI weren't there but I'm sure Dessalines said it\nMalcolm said it, Martin said it\nMarley said it, Ali said it\nGarvey said it, Lumumba said it\nI weren't there but I'm sure Dessalines said it\n\n[Hook]\nIf you ain't found something to die for\nIf you ain't found something to die for\nIf you ain't found something to die for\nIf you ain't found something to die for, you'll never live\n\n[Verse 3: Akala]\nPeople don't rebel, the rebels are the tyrants\nYou are not God, so we are not defiant\nNo human nature, just our behavior\nThe oppressed wanting their oppressor as their saviour\nAround the globe killin', made to be religion\nBut the book said they're sinnin' and that is just the beginnin'\nNow spread democracy by dropping a bomb\nOn a terrorist with no shoes or socks\nI reckon, history teaches us the lesson\nThe bigger terrorist is the one with the bigger weapons\nThey talked but we didn't listen\nThey spoke and then went missin'\nWe can't see all the things that imprison us\n'Cause we don't appreciate the freedoms they have given us\nI wouldn't bet it, that we ever get it\nRun, tell your friends that Akala said it\n[Hook]\n\nMalcolm said it\nMartin said it\nMarley said it\nAli said it\nGarvey said it\nToussaint said it\nI weren't there but I'm sure Dessalines said it\nMalcolm said it\nMartin said it\nMarley said it\nAli said it\nGarvey said it\nLumumba said it\nI weren't there but I'm sure Dessalines said it3Embed"

   "lyrics": "Murder Runs The Globe Lyrics[Intro]\n(Murder, murder 8x)\n\n[Verse 1]\nEvery shot that thunders\nThrough the nighttime don't you wonder\nWhat potential was extinguished\nTo keep the flames burning under?\nThrough the underworld and over world\nPrinciples are so the same\nThough we pretend they're not as if they do not control cocaine\nBut you'll find it's connected\nEvery kid in the hood that's living with a death wish\nIs the same as the King who kills for the bling\nBut he is just much more reckless\nIt's the King that I'm talking about\nThough he is born with a silver spoon in his mouth\nHe still gonna clap for the slightest of chat\nAt any world leader that can't back it\nIf he is sitting on the boxes\nThey are just oil or mineral deposits\nFood he is moving fucking with our profit\nSo he better stop it\nThey say money makes the world go round, but it don't\nThat is just not true\nIf you ain't got guns to protect that money\nI'lI regret that, Sonny, it is more fool you\nOnly murder further agendas that money couldn't force\nEliminate the foes who propose\nTo suppose a different course, of course\nA little torture is usually a big supporter\nThough there's nothing quite like killing\nGood riddance to non supporters\nWe demonize the man on the corner\nPaint him as a thug\nWe worship murder so much\nIt's just that he ain't killed enough\nYou wanna commit murder\nBut not end up in cuffs?\nYou gotta make it to the Premier League\nA thousand murders plus\n[Hook]\nWho said money makes the world go 'round?\nThey just didn't know\nMurder runs the globe\nM-m-murder runs the globe\n\n[Verse 2]\nEvery knife that puncture lungs of sons\nDon't make you wonder Mums?\nIf he was born to billionaires backed by a hundred guns\nWould he be living still, drinking, sleeping, eating meals?\nInstead of dead where it don't count\nWe expect you to be killed\nBecause living as a pauper is a fate that is tainted\nAcquainted with torture\nWe ain't debating the rape of the daughter\nIf she was raised in particular borders\nPlace that fate made particular slaughters\nNo fate just particular orders\nIt's the way of the world no accident\nIn fact it's immaculate\nYou got a big gun start clapping it\nCause the language of power devour quick\nAny silly biddy little pacifist or activist or challenges\nBrown or black skin savages\nWho inhabiting land with minerals in it\nWho think for a minute that the rhetoric we spoke\nHope? Was not meant to be a joke\nDon't dream compassion will happen it won't\nJust go straight for the throat\nBecause any nation or races\nThat prove themselves incapable\nOf matching modern murder machines\nMake themselves enslavable\nIt is murder not money we desire insatiable\nThe thrilling of the killing it's million dollars sensational, YES!\nWhat you can't do with a bribe\nCan be achieved in a breeze with a gun and a knife\nBecause only murder further agendas that money couldn't grind\nNothing like a couple dead kids to change a parents' mind\nYou might also like[Hook]\nWho said money makes the world go 'round?\nThey just didn't know\nMurder runs the globe\nM-m-murder runs the globe\n\n[Verse 3]\nLet's get a little clarity\nYou ain't got the capacity to internationally\nHave a say in the ways things happening\nYou expect to collect more battering\nYour arsenal it ain't got no nukes\nArmies equipped with too few troops\nWe're laughing at you when you call truce\nIt's part of the ritual to shoot-shoot-shoot\nYou got no background in colonization\nOr public resource privatization\nYou can't bang with the big boys, face it\nBut you still wanna play like Satan\nYou got no death squads to call your own\nOr a pilot to fly your drones\nMuch less bulldozers for their homes\nTalk gangster and you want to name Al Capone?\nHe was an amateur, silly little boys don't understand\nEven he went jail for tax evasion\nFor missing a payment in the payment plan\nTo the man, one with invisible hand\nAnd a hidden fist to enforce my plan\nI am just because I can more wicked than the Summer of Sam\nKick your shit and I kick mine fam\nYou bust your gun and I bomb your land\nOnly murder further agendas that money can't control\nNothing like a massacred village to get the problem solved!\n[Hook]\nWho said money makes the world go 'round?\nThey just didn't know\nMurder runs the globe\nM-m-murder runs the globe3Embed"

   "lyrics": "Another Reason Lyrics[Verse 1:]\nWater cuts rock, so which has more force?\nAs water shapes the land, it's still willing to change it's course\nSo can't even change your own minds? Usually change nothing\nCan't ever blame your own mind? Always blame something\nBut in failure, hides opportunity\nIn divided communities still residing is unity\nWaiting to show itself soon as we're ready to see it\nTruth is always there, soon as we are ready to be it\nSo we can keep pretending what's real is just the senses\nBut it is all the same when you're looking with stronger lenses\nSo concerned with images, but it's there in the words\nImages are just imagination, thats whats so absurd\nHave you heard the Pig now knows it's fat?\nAnd the Zebra is confused because it's white and it's black?\nSo what's fact, right and exact when everything changes\nChange the way you look at the world, the world changes\n[Hook:]\nInstead of reasons to die, find a reason to live\nInstead of reasons to fight, find a reason to give\nInstead of reasons to talk, find a reason to sing\nInstead of reasons to take, find a reason to bring\n\nInstead of reasons for I, find a reason for we\nInstead of reasons to try, find a reason to be\nInstead of reasons to look, find a reason to see\nPeople, I am pleading, find another reason\n\n[Verse 2:]\nWe are so busy noticing money don't grow on trees\nWe forgot that food does and that it's the food that we need\nYou see, I done traveled all over the Isles\nAnd seen the poorest people with the wealthiest smiles\nSo what is Rich or Poor, Less or More?\nWhat's victory? What's defeat? And who keeps the score?\nWho sleeps more soundly, the Prince or the Pauper?\nWho speaks more profoundly, the Professor or just the talker?\nThe walker or the driver, who travels the furthest?\nThe explorer or the pirate, who is providing a service?\nWho decides what is worthless, versus what has a purpose?\nDid the so-called civilized world not think the earth a flat surface yesterday?\nSo, who knows what tomorrow brings?\nIt often is the oddest of songs that tomorrow sings\nLook back through the ages, everything changes\nChange the way you look at the world, the world changes\nYou might also like[Hook:]\n\n[Breakdown:]\nWe find all these reasons\nTo never be the person we want to be\nBecause I'm still healing\nAll these wounds that are burned\nSo deep inside of me\n\n[Verse 3:]\nWe think that we're smart and that makes us dumb\nThink that we feel the most and that makes us numb\nWeak because we\u2019re convinced that we have the power\nBecause we can make buildings and guns, but not a single flower\nWe're just waves but think we're the ocean\nBecause it's easier then admitting\nWe don't know where the current is going\nWe're just flowing\nWhy do we feel it needs controlling?\nWaves just rolls with the ocean until they reach the sand\nSo let's roll with our part, until we reach our land\nAcknowledge that the fear in our hearts, totally in our hands\nIt's not a thing, we just think\nImagine the Earth decided that it was afraid to spin?\nSo don't be afraid, to sing with your voice\nThat's what it is for\nThe more we run from truth, the closer it gets to your door\nLook back through the ages, everything changes\nChange the way you look at yourself, the self changes\n[Hook:]9Embed"

Needs to be understood\nIn its fullest context not just as a product of the hood\nCos Miles Davis was rich and still played with the same feeling\nIt\u2019s that cultural memory go and ask Steven\nElla Fitzgerald scatting's basically rapping\nWhen we know we lost our language then you know what has happened\nSo when you hear somebody\u2019s rapping, the base of it is African\nIt ain't about excluding no one; it's just accurate\u2026\n[Hook: Akala]\nKNOWLEDGE...IS...POWER!\nDon't let them tell you 'bout yourself\nNever that's your wealth\nKNOWLEDGE...IS...POWER!\nIf you dont feed your mind how can you live in health?\nKNOWLEDGE...IS...POWER!\nDon't let them tell you 'bout yourself\nNever that's your wealth\n\n[Verse 2: Akala]\nLook around hip hop\u2019s becomes this global voice\nBut we must understand its roots so we can have a choice\nWhat we should do with it how to use it\nHow to teach our students\nCos Viacom is not our cultural institution\nBut it will use this culture for its prostitution\nAnd our destruction, anything but a solution\nThe ghetto dilemma's as bad as its ever been\nPeople are dead, just ain't rememberin'\nRoots of the rhythm and bass\n[?] thing is as good as the parts that assemble it\nHamlet is writing, we think the pencil is\nPeople are sacred, we think the Temple is\nIf i'm uncomfortable you shouldn't mention it\nIm superior so watch your sentences\nDon\u2019t disturb my privileged pensioners\nLiving off ignorance of all the members of\nEvery one of all the people we severed off\nNever one of all the people we\u2019re never soft\nAny gun or the better we sell it off\nAny sum of all the cheddar we level off\nCultural suicide is a necessity\nTo get you to worship celebrity\nCos people with a strong sense of themselves could say that we\u2019ll never be\nYou might also like[hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Akala]\nWhen they say that Knowledge ain't for you and your people\nThey\u2019re tryna' keep you less than equal\nCos deep down in themselves, that\u2019s how they really see you\nLess based on status\nOr the places you was raised in\nOr the shape of your faces\nDegrees or bank statements\nSo we gotta reject  Whatever they set\nThey\u2019re never benevolent yet\nYet we sit at a desk Collecting a check\nNo need to ever respect\nMess coupled by death\nTripled by theft\nLook at the West and the rest\nTransfer knowledge transfer the power then tell me what is left\nBliss? No ignorance\nIt just just his head that is numbing the pain\nOnly the clever shit should ever change\nOur development towards an aim\nNo bro, push of the chain\nTraining the muscle is training the brain\nIt is the same if you push through the pain\nOnce you are strong you are never the same\nYour manner your swagger\nThe way that you stand up\nThe way that you work with your boys as a rapper\nI\u2019ve seen a killer convert from a trapper\nTo working with yout dem and tellin\u2019 em man up\nI am not telling you it will get better\nBut if we are to fight we must keep our jabber\nC\u2019mon my people stand up\n\n\n[HOOK] x22Embed"

Akala went on to reuse the instrumental in 2008, when he released The War Mixtape, Vol. 2.\n\nThe song was used in British 2006 film, KiDULTHOOD."
