This is a tune coming in\nThat one noise is like\n\n[Chorus: Mike Skinner & Jackie Rawe]\nI'm thinking\nLights are blinding my eyes\nMy eyes are rolling back\nI'm rubbing my thighs with my hand\nAnd I'm thinking\nPeople pushing by\nThen walking off into the night\n\n[Verse 8: Mike Skinner]\nYeah, yeah, they cheer\nCan they see my hand in the air?\nI need to wave 'em over here\nI swear Simone's kissing Dan\nMy head's twisted severe\nBody is rushing everywhere\nThey could have texted me when they were near\nBut I'm fucked and I don't care\n\n[Chorus: Mike Skinner & Jackie Rawe]\nLights are blinding my eyes\nWhat was I thinking about?\nAh, who cares\nI'm mashed\nPeople pushing by\nThen walking off into the night\nTotally fucking\nCan't hardly fucking stand\nThis is fucking amazing\nAh-ha12Embed"

Oh, oh, oh, oh\nOriginal Pirate Material\nYou're listening to The Streets, lock down your aerial\nHas it come to this? Oh, oh, oh, oh\nOriginal Pirate Material\nYou're listening to The Streets, lock down your aerial\n\n[Verse 1: Mike Skinner]\nMake yourself at home\nWe got diesel or some of that homegrown\nSit back in your throne and turn off your phone 'cause this is our zone\nVideos, televisions\n64s, PlayStations\nWeigh up Henry with precision\nFew herbs and a bit of Benson\nBut don't forget the Rizla\nLean like the Tower of Pisa\nThese are our ways, yeah\nAnd this is the day in the life of a geezer\nFor this ain't a club track\nPull out your sack and sit back\nWhether you white or black\nSmoke weed, chase brown, or toot rock\nWe're on a mission, support the cause\nSign a petition, summon all your wisdom\nThe music's a gift from\nThe man on high, the Lord, and his children\nTriple team here of rude boys\nCome rain or snow, the boodah flows\nYou don't know? Stand on the corner, watch the show 'cause life moves slow\nSort your shit out, then roll\nSex, drugs, and on the dole\nSome men rise, some men fall\nI hear your call, stand tall now\n[Chorus: Mike Skinner & Keith Hammond]\nHas it come to this? Oh, oh, oh, oh\nOriginal Pirate Material\nYou're listening to The Streets, lock down your aerial\nHas it come to this? Oh, oh, oh, oh\nOriginal Pirate Material\nYou're listening to The Streets, lock down your aerial\n\n[Verse 2: Mike Skinner]\nI'm just spitting, think I'm ghetto?\nStop dreaming, my data's streaming\nI'm giving your bird them feelings\nTouch your toes, then touch the ceiling\nWe walk the tightrope of street cred\nKeep my dogs fed, all jungle, all garage heads\nGold teeth, Valentinos, and dreads now\nWe were verbally slapped up\nPhysically tip-top, spinally ripped up\nI do the science on my laptop\nAnd I get my boys mashed up\nYou're listening to The Streets\nYou'll bear witness to some amazing feats\nBravery in the face of defeat\nAll line up and grab your seat\n'Cause Tony's got a new motor\nSR Nova, driving like a joyrider\nSpeeding to the corner\nYour mother warned ya, it's a sound system banger\nYou might also like[Chorus: Mike Skinner & Keith Hammond]\nHas it come to this? Oh, oh, oh, oh\nOriginal Pirate Material\nYou're listening to The Streets, lock down your aerial\nHas it come to this? Oh, oh, oh, oh\nOriginal Pirate Material\nYou're listening to The Streets, lock down your aerial\n\n[Verse 3: Mike Skinner]\nMy Underground train runs from Mile End to Ealing, from Brixton to Bounds Green\nMy spitting's dirty, my beats are clean\nSo smoke weed and be lean\nI step out my yard through the streets\nIn the dead heat, all I got's my spirit and my beats\nI play fair, don't cheat, and keep the gangsters sweet\nTurn the page, don't rip it out at your age, move to the next stage\nLock the rage inside the cage, like SK, it's a new day\nBut don't take the shortcut through the subway\nIt's pay or play, these geezers walk the gang way\nDeep-seated urban decay, deep-seated urban decay\nRip down posters I like from last week's big garage night\nAnd the next Tyson fight\nI cook 'em at ninety degrees Fahrenheit and don't copy the copyright\nI got 'em in my sights\nBlinding with the lights, taken to dizzy new heights\nBlinding with the lights, blinding with the lights\nDizzy new heights\n[Chorus: Mike Skinner & Keith Hammond]\nHas it come to this? Oh, oh, oh, oh\nOriginal Pirate Material\nYou're listening to The Streets, lock down your aerial\nHas it come to this? Oh, oh, oh, oh\nOriginal Pirate Material\nYou're listening to The Streets, lock down your aerial\nHas it come to this? Oh, oh, oh, oh\nOriginal Pirate Material\nYou're listening to The Streets, lock down your aerial\nHas it come to this? Oh, oh, oh, oh\nOriginal Pirate Material\nYou're listening to The Streets, lock down your aerial\nHas it come to this? Oh, oh, oh, oh\nOriginal Pirate Material\nYou're listening to The Streets, lock down your aerial\nHas it come to this? Oh, oh, oh, oh\nOriginal Pirate Material\nYou're listening to The Streets, lock down your aerial\nHas it come to this? Oh, oh, oh, oh\nOriginal Pirate Material\nYou're listening to The Streets, lock down your aerial\nHas it come to this? Oh, oh, oh, oh\nOriginal Pirate Material\nYou're listening to The Streets, lock down your aerial\nHas it come to this? Oh, oh, oh, oh\nOriginal Pirate Material\nYou're listening to The Streets, lock down your aerial4Embed"

Guaranteed accuracy, enhanced CD\nLatest technology, darts hit treble twenty\nHuge non-recoupable advance, majors be vigilant\nI excel in both content and deliverance\nSo let's put on our classics and we'll have a little dance, shall we?\nNo sales pitch, no media hype\nNo hydro, it's nice and ripe\nI speak in communications in bold type\nThis ain't your archetypal street sound, scan for ultrasounds\nNorth, south, east, west and all 'round\nAnd then to the underground\n[Chorus: Kevin Mark Trail]\nYou say that everything sounds the same\nThen you go buy them\nThere's no excuses, my friend\nLet's push things forward\nYou say that everything sounds the same\nThen you go buy them\nThere's no excuses, my friend\nLet's push things forward\n\n[Verse 2: Mike Skinner]\nAs we progress to the check point\nI wholeheartedly agree with your viewpoint\nBut this ain't your typical garage joint\nI make points which hold significance\nThat ain't a bag, it's a shipment\nThis ain't a track, it's a movement\nI got the settlement\nMy frequencies are transient and resonate your eardrums\nI make bangers, not anthems\nLeave that to The Artful Dodger\nThe broad-shouldered fifty-one percent shareholder\nYou won't find us on Alta Vista\nCult classic, not bestseller\nYou're gonna need more power\nPlug in the three-phase and the generator\nCrank it up to the gigawatts\nCritics, ready with your pot shots, the plot thickens\nPut on your mittens for these sub-zero conditions\nBut remember I'm just spitting, remember I'm just spitting\nOnce bitten, forever smitten\nYou might also like[Chorus: Kevin Mark Trail]\nYou say that everything sounds the same\nThen you go buy them\nThere's no excuses, my friend\nLet's push things forward\nYou say that everything sounds the same\nThen you go buy them\nThere's no excuses, my friend\nLet's push things forward\n\n[Verse 3: Mike Skinner]\nSpit jewels like Eastern riches, junkie fixes\nAround here, we say \"birds\", not \"bitches\"\nAs London Bridge burns down, Brixton's burning up\nTurns out you're in luck, 'cause I know this dodgy fuck in the Duck\nSo it's just another show flick from your local city poet\nIn case you geezers don't know it, let's push things forward\nIt's a tall order, but we're taller\nCalling all maulers, back street brawlers\nCorner shop crawlers, victory's flawless\nLove us or hate us, but don't slate us\nDon't conform to formulas, pop genres and such\nSharp darts, Double Dutch\nParked cars, troubles are much\nWith more bud\nLet's push things forward\n[Chorus: Kevin Mark Trail]\nYou say that everything sounds the same\nThen you go buy them\nThere's no excuses, my friend\nLet's push things forward\nYou say that everything sounds the same\nThen you go buy them\nThere's no excuses, my friend\nLet's push things forward3Embed"

Oi! Oi! Oi!\"\n[Chorus: Calvin Bailey]\nHold it down, boy, your head's gettin' blurred\nI know you can't stop thinkin' of her\nBy all means, you can vibe with this girl\nBut just don't mug yourself, that's all, don't mug yourself\n\n[Interlude]\nSeriously Mick, you fucker\nNo, no, no! Do you know what I mean?\nI'll fuckin'\u2014 I'm\u2014 no way, really, do you know what I mean?\nI'm fuckin'\u2014 I can take it or leave it, believe\nAnd then Calvin's like, \"Oi!\"\n\n[Verse 2: Mike Skinner]\nYou need to hold it down, Jack, put your phone back\nQuit starin' into space and eat your snack, that's that\nShe'll want you much more for not hangin' on\nStop me if I'm wrong, stop me if I'm wrong\nWhy should she be the one who decides\nWhether it's off or on, or on, or off or on?\nNow the girl's rude, I know she's rude\nBut she's screwed right through you, you'll be on your knees soon\n\n[Chorus: Calvin Bailey]\nHold it down, boy, your head's gettin' blurred\nI know you can't stop thinkin' of her\nBy all means, you can vibe with this girl\nBut just don't mug yourself, that's all, don't mug yourself\nYou might also like[Verse 3: Mike Skinner]\nAnd I'm like, honestly, it's not like that\nYou're actin' like I'm prancin' like a sap\nJumpin' when she claps and that\nOi, do you really think I act wack?\n'Cause I'm telling ya\nI'm servin' the aces and it's game, set and match\nPerfectly in control of this goal\nI've got the lead role, won't be foldin', I'm older than you told\nGirl sold, high speed's gold\nGame over, game over, too cold\n\n[Chorus: Calvin Bailey]\nHold it down, boy, your head's gettin' blurred\nI know you can't stop thinkin' of her\nBy all means, you can vibe with this girl\nBut just don't mug yourself, that's all, don't mug yourself\nHold it down, boy, your head's gettin' blurred\nI know you can't stop thinkin' of her\nBy all means, you can vibe with this girl\nBut just don't mug yourself, that's all, don't mug yourself\n\n[Outro: Calvin Bailey]\nOh-oh, yeah\nHold it down, boy, your head's gettin' blurred\nI know you can't stop thinkin' of her\nThat girl is\u2014 she has smelly on her Ps\nShe must have crab and fuckin' shrimp in her teeth (Oh-oh-oh)\nNo, oh, no, that's it, that's it\nHold on, let me go again, let me go again\nAre we\u2014 Are we still recording?\nWoah, yeah2Embed"

    "plain": "The closing track on The Streets' debut album, Original Pirate Material\n\nThis track communicates with the listener on a second-person basis. Skinner uses the term \u201cyou\u201d throughout to make the listener aware of what he\u2019s saying, instead of just listening to the (very nice) beat and disregarding the lyrics completely.\n\nOn this track Skinner discusses the power of positivity and uses typical negative situations and solutions to give the subject context (e.g. drug abuse, financial problems and general failure).\n\nStay Positive clocks in at 6:16, making it the longest track on the album."

Skinner uses the term \u201cyou\u201d throughout to make the listener aware of what he\u2019s saying, instead of just listening to the (very nice) beat and disregarding the lyrics completely.\n\nOn this track Skinner discusses the power of positivity and uses typical negative situations and solutions to give the subject context (e.g. drug abuse, financial problems and general failure).\n\nStay Positive clocks in at 6:16, making it the longest track on the album."

   "lyrics": "Stay Positive Lyrics[Verse 1]\n'Cause this world swallows souls\nAnd when the blues unfold, it gets cold, solids burns holes\nYou're going mad, perhaps you always were\nBut when things was good, you just didn't care\nThis is called irony\nWhen you most need to get up, you got no energy\nTime and time, shit'll happen, the dark shit's unwrapping\nBut no-one's listening, your mates are laughing\nYour bredren's fucking and then you start hating\nYour stomach starts churning and your mind starts turning\nSo smoke another draw\nIt won't matter no more, but the next day still feels sore\nRain taps on your window, always did, though\nBut you didn't hear it when things was so-so\nYou're on your own now, your little zone\nYou were born alone and believe me, you'll die alone\nWeed becomes a chore\nYou want the buzz back, so you follow the others onto smack\n[Chorus]\nJust try and stay positive\nJust try and stay positive\nJust try and stay positive\nJust try and stay positive\n\n[Verse 2]\nFeels nice and still\nGood thing about brown is it always will\nIt's easy, no-one blames you\nIt's that world out there that's fucked you\nYou're no less of a person and if God exists, He still loves you\nJust remember that\nThe more you sink, the further back from that brink\nMaybe you have lifetime scars\nAnd you think tattoos might be more fitting, but who's picking?\nSearching for yourself, you find demons\nTry and be a free man and grasp that talisman\n'Cause you're the same as I am\nWe all need our fellow man, we all need our Samaritan\nMaybe I'm better looking than you, though\nMaybe I've got more dough, but am I happier? No\nGet the love of a good girl\nAnd your world will be much richer than my world\nAnd your happiness will uncurl\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nJust try and stay positive\nJust try and stay positive\nJust try and stay positive\nJust try and stay positive\n\n[Verse 3]\n\"Stop dreaming\"\nPeople who say that are blaspheming\nThey're doing nine-to-five and moaning\nAnd they don't want you succeeding when they've blown it\nAnd your idols, who are they?\nThey, too, dreamt about their day\nPositive steps will see your goals\nWhether it's dollars or control, feel the gold\nI ain't helping you climb the ladder, I'm busy climbing mine\nThat's how it's been since the dawn of time\nIf you reach a cul-de-sac, the world turns its back\nThis is your zone, it's like blackjack\nHe might get the ace or the top one\nSo organise your twos and threes into a run\nAnd then you'll have fucked him, son\nAnd for that, you'll be the better one\nOne last thing before you go, though\nWhen you feel better tomorrow, you'll be a hero\nBut never forget today\nYou could be back here, things can stray\nBut what if you see me in that window?\nYou won't help me, I know\nThat's cool, just keep walking where you go\nCarry on through the estate\nStare at the geezers so they know you ain't lightweight\nAnd go see your mates\nAnd when they don't look happy\nPlay 'em this tape\n[Chorus]\nJust try and stay positive\nJust try and stay positive\nJust try and stay positive\nJust try and stay positive\nJust try and stay positive (I hope you understand me)\nJust try and stay positive\n\n[Verse 4]\nI ain't no preaching fucker and I ain't no do-goody-goody either\nThis is about when shit goes pear-shaped\nAnd if you aren't or never have been at rock bottom\nThen good luck to you in the big wide world\nBut remember that one day, shit might just start crumbling\nYour bird might fuck off or you might lose your job\nIt's when that happens that what I'm talking about will feel much more important to you\nSo if you ain't feeling it, just be thankful that things are cool in your world\nRespect to BC\nPositivity\nPositivity\n\n[Chorus]\nJust try and stay positive\nJust try and stay positive\nJust try and stay positive\nJust try and stay positive\nJust try and stay positive\nJust try and stay positive\nJust try and stay positive\nJust try and stay positive6Embed"

No, you can't\nIt's not my fault there's wall-to-wall empty cans\nEveryone wanted this to all go wrong for me from the start\nIt's fucked up that a man's life can just be attacked\nWatching This Morning with a beer is much better than relying on\nKnown cunts for mates I was given that don't have my back\nScott texted me to say he'd have a look at the TV for me\nBut I laid it down, telling him to fuck right off, chap\nPhoned this company out the Yellow Pages\nTold them to take away the TV, fix it quick snap\nThe next day they took away the TV\nTold me they would repair the little bit\nThat's broken 'round on the back\nI thought that'd be that, but the next bit was on top\nThis was where it all started to get a bit out of hand\n[Chorus]\nNo one gives a crap about Mike\nThat's why I'm acting nasty\nYou know what you can do with your life?\nIntroduce it up your jacksie\n'Cause no one gives a crap about Mike\nThat's why I'm acting nasty\nYou know what you can do with your life\nIntroduce it up your jacksie\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe TV man comes back later, knocks on mine\nTo say he's found something in the back of the TV\nI'm looking at it absolutely speechless\nCan't quite believe he's trying to pull this fucking stunt on me\nI knew it was a simple case of the power supply gone on the back\nBut he's trying to tap me up for more money\nHe says, \"It's not like that,\" and I'm like, \"Fuck off and die\"\nAnd stick up my two fingers and one more to make three\nAnd he says, \"Don't talk to me like that,\" and \"I don't understand\"\nMy face is in his face, I tell him I understand perfectly\nAnd he grabs my shirt and I grab his face with my hand\nSo he brings his fist up and twats me a good one on my cheek\nThen I'm trying to pull his head down\nSo I can knee it, but he's got my ear\nHe's twisting it 'round so much it's really hurting me\nAnd we both go down on the floor, and he pushes my head\nBack onto the corner of the fridge, which is total agony\nThen he gets up and runs out of the kitchen and out of the door\nShouting stuff to me, slams his door, shouting to me\nSo here I am in my house, drinking on my own settee\nEveryone's a cunt in this life, no one's there for me\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nNo one gives a crap about Mike\nThat's why I'm acting nasty\nYou know what you can do with your life?\nIntroduce it up your jacksie\n'Cause no one gives a crap about Mike\nThat's why I'm acting nasty\nYou know what you can do with your life\nIntroduce it up your jacksie\n(*sound of a rewinding tape*)\n\n[Verse 3]\nIf I want to sit in and drink Super Tennent's in the day, I will\nNo one's gonna fuckin' tell me jack\nBut can you rely on anyone in this world? No, you can't\nIt's all my fault there's wall-to-wall empty cans\nI sat in the kitchen, all fucked off\nImagining over and over what they were all doing behind my back\nDodgy things going on, actions I regretted\nStain bottle with a pipe and tin foil on the mat\nScott texted me to say he'd have a look at the TV for me\nAnd I felt like just telling him to fuck right off, chap\nBut what he said about wanting to do\nThe right thing by both mates\nAnd then opting to stay out? It seemed to match\nBut I told him he could make it up by fixing the TV\nHe said that's the least he could do to square things flat\nI thought that'd be that, but then the next bit was mad\nThis is where everything started to all turn back\n[Chorus]\nIt's the end of something I did not want to end\nBeginning of hard times to come\nBut something that was not meant to be is done\nAnd this is the start of what was\n\n[Verse 4]\nHe had to unscrew about fifteen screws\nBefore he could pull the panel off the back\nTo get in the fecking thing\nBut just as he did so, he said he saw summat\nThat slipped inside behind the panel down the back of it\nMust have been some leaflets or a bill maybe\nI didn't wanna lose the bill in case it was a final warning\nSo we both tried to get the back off and work out\nIf there were any more screws to get out or if we left any in\nAnd when he looked down the back of the TV, his eyes just froze\nBefore he rammed his hand in, saying, \"No shit!\"\nHe's looking at me absolutely speechless\nHe can't quite believe what he's trying to pull out the slit\nI get up, wondering what he's smiling about\nHe's shaking his head at this point with the biggest of grins\nI look down the back of the TV and that's where it was\nIn all its glory: my thousand quid\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's the end of something I did not want to end\nBeginning of hard times to come\nBut something that was not meant to be is done\nAnd this is the start of what was\n\n[Verse 5]\nAbout two this afternoon, the last of the people left my house\n'Cause they never stop chatting 'til all the racket's gone\nI really feel like things clicked into place at some point\nOr maybe it's the fact that me and Alison really got on\nOr maybe it's that I realised that it is true\nNo-one's really there fighting for you in the last garrison\nNo-one except yourself that is, no-one except you\nYou are the one who's got your back 'til the last deed's done\nScott can't have my back 'til the absolute end\n'Cause he's got to look out for what over his horizon\nHe's gotta make sure he's not lonely, not broke\nIt's enough to worry about keeping his own head above\nI shut the door behind me, huddled up in my coat\nCondensation floating off my breath, squinted out the sun\nMy jeans felt a bit tight, I think I washed them too high\nI was gonna be late, so I picked up my pace to run\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's the end of something I did not want to end\nBeginning of hard times to come\nBut something that was not meant to be is done\nAnd this is the start of what was\nIt's the end of something I did not want to end\nBeginning of hard times to come\nBut something that was not meant to be is done\nAnd this is the start of what was\nIt's the end of something I did not want to end\nBeginning of hard times to come\nBut something that was not meant to be is done\nAnd this is the start of what was\nIt's the end of something I did not want to end\nBeginning of hard times to come\nBut something that was not meant to be is done\nAnd this is the start of what was1Embed"

I'll give you public disorder\nI down eight pints and run all over the place\nSpit in the face of an officer\nSee if that bothers ya 'cause I never broke a law in my life\nSomeday, I'm gonna settle down with a wife\nCome on, lads, let's have another fight\n[Verse 2]\nUm, hello, my name's Tim and I'm a criminal\nIn the eyes of society, I need to be in jail\nFor the choice of herbs I inhale\nThis ain't no wholesale operation\nJust a few eighths and some PlayStation's my vocation\nI pose a threat to the nation\nAnd down the station, the police hold no patience\nLet's talk space and time\nI like to get deep sometimes and think about Einstein\nAnd Carl Jung, and old Kung Fu movies I like to see\nPass the hydrator please\nYeah, I'm floating on thin air\nGoing to Amsterdam in the New Year, top gear there\n'Cause I take pride in my hobby\nHomemade bongs using my engineering degree\nDear leaders, please legalise weed for these reasons\n\n[Verse 3]\nLike I was saying to him\nI told him, \"Fuck with me and you won't live\"\nSo I smacked him in the head and downed another Carling\nBada-bada-bing, for the lads like\nMad fight, his face a sad sight, vodka and snakebite\nGoing on like a right geez, he's a twat\nShouldn't have looked at me like that\nAnyway, I'm an upstanding citizen\nIf a war came along, I'd be on the front line with 'em\nCan't stand crime either, them hooligans on heroin\nDrugs and criminal\nThose thugs are the pinnacle of the downfall of society\nI've got all the anger pent up inside of me\nYou might also like[Verse 4]\nYou know, I don't see why I should be the criminal\nHow can something with no recorded fatalities be illegal?\nAnd how many deaths are there per year from alcohol?\nI just completed Gran Turismo on the hardest setting\nWe pose no threat on my settee\nOoh, the pizza's here, will someone let him in, please?\nWe didn't order chicken\nNot a problem, we'll pick it out\nI doubt they meant to mess us about\nAfter all, we're all adults, not louts\nAs I was saying, we're friendly, peaceful people\nWe're not the ones out there causing trouble\nWe just sit in this hazy bubble with our quarters\nDiscussing how beautiful Gail Porter is\nMTV, BBC Two, Channel 4 is on 'til six in the morning\nThen six in the morning, the sun dawns and it's my bed time\n\n[Verse 5]\nCausing trouble? You're stinking rabble\nPoised, saying I'm the lad who's spoiling it? You're on drugs\nReally bugs me when people try and tell me I'm a thug\nJust for getting drunk, I like getting drunk\n'Cause I'm an upstanding citizen\nIf a war came along, I'd be on the front line with 'em\n[Verse 6]\nNow Terry, you're repeating yourself\nBut that's okay, drunk people can't help that\nA chemical reaction happening inside your brain\nCauses you to forget what you're saying\n\n[Verse 7]\nWhat? I know exactly what I'm saying\nI'm perfectly sane, you stinking student lame-o\nGo get a job and stop robbing us of our taxes\n\n[Verse 8]\nErm, well, actually, according to research\nGovernment funding for further education pales in insignificance\nWhen compared to how much they spend on repairing\nLairy drunk people at the weekend\nIn casualty wards all over the land\n\n[Verse 9]\nWhy, you cheeky little swine, come here\nI'm gonna batter ya, come here1Embed"

No, don't think so somehow\nIn the winter showers\nBut she'll never know and your face will never show shit\nThis is how goes it, besides, she was well fit, and who could resist?\nMove up to the next place, a smooth club to flex bass\nBeats, and your best mates\nAll down, nice sound, Smirnoff Ice rounds\nMCs clowning, rudeboys frowning\nEverything's sweet, everything's tucked in\nAnd 'round here, we're all downing\nBut all of a sudden though, just through the smoke\nIt's your bird laughing and joking with a bloke\nAin't just that either, as she moves closer\nIn a shape what looks like they're lovers, he's tonguing her\nAll rage sweeps up through your torso\nYou're more so ready to go over and show him who's man\nFootball fan style, leave it in the can for awhile\n'Cause even as they smile, he's still got choices\nDon't listen to them voices\nThat at the end of the day you may just have caused this\nSo leave the forces\n[Chorus: Mike Skinner]\nGeezers need excitement\nIf their lives don't provide 'em this, they incite violence\nCommon sense, simple common sense\nGeezers need excitement\nIf their lives don't provide 'em this, they incite violence\nCommon sense, simple common sense1Embed"
